<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>THE HIGHLAND FEUD.</h3>
</div>

<p>Why should I, Murdoch M'Crimman of Coila, be
condemned for a period of indefinite length to the
drudgery of the desk's dull wood? That is the question
I have just been asking myself. Am I emulous of the
honour and glory that, they say, float halo-like round the
brow of the author? Have I the desire to awake and
find myself famous? The fame, alas! that authors chase
is but too often an <i>ignis fatuus</i>. No; honour like theirs
I crave not, such toil is not incumbent on me. Genius in
a garret! To some the words may sound romantic enough,
but&mdash;ah me!&mdash;the position seems a sad one. Genius
munching bread and cheese in a lonely attic, with nothing
betwixt the said genius and the sky and the cats but
rafters and tiles! I shudder to think of it. If my will
were omnipotent, Genius should never shiver beneath the
tiles, never languish in an attic. Genius should be clothed
in purple and fine linen, Genius should&mdash;&mdash; 'Yes, aunt,
come in; I'm not very busy yet.'</p>
<p>My aunt sails into my beautiful room in the eastern
tower of Castle Coila.</p>
<p>'I was afraid,' she says, almost solemnly, 'I might be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
disturbing your meditations. Do I find you really at
work?'</p>
<p>'I've hardly arrived at that point yet, dear aunt. Indeed,
if the truth will not displease you, I greatly fear serious
concentration is not very much in my line. But as you
desire me to write our strange story, and as mother also
thinks the duty devolves on me, behold me seated at my
table in this charming turret chamber, which owes its all
of comfort to your most excellent taste, auntie mine.'</p>
<p>As I speak I look around me. The evening sunshine
is streaming into my room, which occupies the whole of
one story of the tower. Glance where I please, nothing
is here that fails to delight the eye. The carpet beneath
my feet is soft as moss, the tall mullioned windows are
bedraped with the richest curtains. Pictures and mirrors
hang here and there, and seem part and parcel of the
place. So does that dark lofty oak bookcase, the great
harp in the west corner, the violin that leans against it,
the <i>jardinière</i>, the works of art, the arms from every land&mdash;the
shields, the claymores, the spears and helmets,
everything is in keeping. This is my garret. If I want
to meditate, I have but to draw aside a curtain in yonder
nook, and lo! a little baize-covered door slides aside and
admits me to one of the tower-turrets, a tiny room in
which fairies might live, with a window on each side
giving glimpses of landscape&mdash;and landscape unsurpassed
for beauty in all broad Scotland.</p>
<p>But it was by the main doorway of my chamber that
auntie entered, drawing aside the curtains and pausing a
moment till she should receive my cheering invitation.
And this door leads on to the roof, and this roof itself is
a sight to see. Loftily domed over with glass, it is at
once a conservatory, a vinery, and tropical aviary. Room
here for trees even, for miniature palms, while birds of
the rarest plumage flit silently from bough to bough among
the oranges, or lisp out the sweet lilts that have descended
to them from sires that sang in foreign lands. Yonder a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
fountain plays and casts its spray over the most lovely
feathery ferns. The roof is very spacious, and the
conservatory occupies the greater part of it, leaving room
outside, however, for a delightful promenade. After
sunset coloured lamps are often lit here, and the place
then looks even more lovely than before. All this, I need
hardly say, was my aunt's doing.</p>
<p>I wave my hand, and the lady sinks half languidly into
a fauteuil.</p>
<p>'And so,' I say, laughingly, 'you have come to visit
Genius in his garret.'</p>
<p>My aunt smiles too, but I can see it is only out of
politeness.</p>
<p>I throw down my pen; I leave my chair and seat myself
on the bearskin beside the ample fireplace and begin
toying with Orla, my deerhound.</p>
<p>'Aunt, play and sing a little; it will inspire me.'</p>
<p>She needs no second bidding. She bends over the great
harp and lightly touches a few chords.</p>
<p>'What shall I play or sing?'</p>
<p>'Play and sing as you feel, aunt.'</p>
<p>'I feel thus,' my aunt says, and her fingers fly over the
strings, bringing forth music so inspiriting and wild that
as I listen, entranced, some words of Ossian come rushing
into my memory:</p>
<p>'The moon rose in the East. Fingal returned in the
gleam of his arms. The joy of his youth was great, their
souls settled as a sea from a storm. Ullin raised the song
of gladness. The hills of Inistore rejoiced. The flame of
the oak arose, and the tales of heroes were told.'</p>
<p>Aunt is not young, but she looks very noble now&mdash;looks
the very incarnation of the music that fills the room. In
it I can hear the battle-cry of heroes, the wild slogan of
clan after clan rushing to the fight, the clang of claymore
on shield, the shout of victory, the wail for the dead.
There are tears in my eyes as the music ceases, and my
aunt turns once more towards me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>'Aunt, your music has made me ashamed of myself.
Before you came I recoiled from the task you had set
before me; I longed to be out and away, marching over
the moors gun in hand and dogs ahead. Now I&mdash;I&mdash;yes,
aunt, this music inspires me.'</p>
<p>Aunt rises as I speak, and together we leave the turret
chamber, and, passing through the great conservatory, we
reach the promenade. We lean on the battlement, long
since dismantled, and gaze beneath us. Close to the castle
walls below is a well-kept lawn trending downwards with
slight incline to meet the loch which laps over its borders.
This loch, or lake, stretches for miles and miles on every
side, bounded here and there by bare, black, beetling cliffs,
and in other places</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>'O'erhung by wild woods thickening green,</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>a very cloudland of foliage. The easternmost horizon of
this lake is a chain of rugged mountains, one glance at
which would tell you the season was autumn, for they are
crimsoned over with blooming heather. The season is
autumn, and the time is sunset; the shadow of the great
tower falls darkling far over the loch, and already crimson
streaks of cloud are ranged along the hill-tops. So silent
and still is it that we can hear the bleating of sheep a
good mile off, and the throb of the oars of a boat far away
on the water, although the boat itself is but a little dark
speck. There is another dark speck, high, high above the
crimson clouds. It comes nearer and nearer; it gets bigger
and bigger; and presently a huge eagle floats over the
castle, making homeward to his eyrie in the cliffs of Ben
Coila.</p>
<p>The air gets cooler as the shadows fall; I draw the shawl
closer round my aunt's shoulders. She lifts a hand as if
to deprecate the attention.</p>
<p>'Listen, Murdoch,' she says. 'Listen, Murdoch
M'Crimman.'</p>
<p>She seldom calls me by my name complete.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>'I may leave you now, may I not?'</p>
<p>'I know what you mean, aunt,' I reply. 'Yes; to the
best of my ability I will write our strange story.'</p>
<p>'Who else would but you, Murdoch M'Crimman, chief
of the house of Crimman, chief of the clan?'</p>
<p>I bow my head in silent sorrow.</p>
<p>'Yes, aunt; I know. Poor father is gone, and I <i>am</i>
chief.'</p>
<p>She touches my hand lightly&mdash;it is her way of taking
farewell. Next moment I am alone. Orla thrusts his
great muzzle into my hand; I pat his head, then go back
with him to my turret chamber, and once more take up
my pen.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A blood feud! Has the reader ever heard of such a
thing? Happily it is unknown in our day. A blood feud&mdash;a
quarrel 'twixt kith and kin, a feud oftentimes bequeathed
from bleeding sire to son, handed down from generation to
generation, getting more bitter in each; a feud that not
even death itself seems enough to obliterate; an enmity
never to be forgotten while hills raise high their heads to
meet the clouds.</p>
<p>Such a feud is surely cruel. It is more, it is sinful&mdash;it
is madness. Yet just such a feud had existed for far more
than a hundred years between our family of M'Crimman
and the Raes of Strathtoul.</p>
<p>There is but little pleasure in referring back to such a
family quarrel, but to do so is necessary. Vast indeed is
the fire that a small spark may sometimes kindle. Two
small dead branches rubbing together as the wind blows
may fire a forest, and cause a conflagration that shall
sweep from end to end of a continent.</p>
<p>It was a hundred years ago, and forty years to that; the
head of the house of Stuart&mdash;Prince Charles Edward,
whom his enemies called the Pretender&mdash;had not yet set
foot on Scottish shore, though there were rumours almost
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
daily that he had indeed come at last. The Raes were
cousins of the M'Crimmans; the Raes were head of the
clan M'Rae, and their country lay to the south of our
estates. It was an ill-fated day for both clans when one
morning a stalwart Highlander, flying from glen to glen
with the fiery cross waving aloft, brought a missive to the
chief of Coila. The Raes had been summoned to meet
their prince; the M'Crimman had been <i>solicited</i>. In two
hours' time the straths were all astir with preparations
for the march. No boy or man who could carry arms,
'twixt the ages of sixteen and sixty, but buckled his
claymore to his side and made ready to leave. Listen to
the wild shout of the men, the shrill notes of bagpipes,
the wailing of weeping women and children! Oh, it was
a stirring time; my Scotch blood leaps in all my veins as
I think of it even now. Right on our side; might on our
side! We meant to do or die!</p>

<p>M'Crimman of Coila that evening met the Raes
hastening towards the lake.</p>
<p>'Ah, kinsman,' cried M'Crimman, 'this is indeed a
glorious day! I have been summoned by letter from the
royal hands of our bold young prince himself.'</p>
<p>'And I, chief of the Raes, have been summoned by
cross. A letter was none too good for Coila. Strathtoul
must be content to follow the pibroch and drum.'</p>
<p>'It was an oversight. My brother must neither fret
nor fume. If our prince but asked me, I'd fight in the
ranks for him, and carry musket or pike or pistol.'</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>'It's good being you, with your letter and all that.
Kinsman though you be, I'd have you know, and I'd have
our prince understand, that the Raes and Crimmans are
one and the same family, and equal where they stand
or fall.'</p>
<p>'Of that,' said the proud Coila, drawing himself up and
lowering his brows, 'our prince is the best judge.'</p>
<p>'These are pretty airs to give yourself, M'Crimman!
One would think your claymore drank blood every
morning!'</p>
<p>'Brother,' said M'Crimman, 'do not let us quarrel. I
have orders to see your people on the march. They are
to come with us. I must do my duty.'</p>
<p>'Never!' shouted Rae. 'Never shall my clan obey
your commands!'</p>
<p>'You refuse to fight for Charlie?'</p>
<p>'Under your banner&mdash;yes!'</p>
<p>'Then draw, dog! Were you ten times more closely
related to me, you should eat your words or drown them
in your blood!'</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards the M'Crimmans were on the
march southwards, their bold young chief at their head,
banners streaming and pibroch ringing! but, alas! their
kinsman Rae lay stark and stiff on the bare hillside.</p>
<p>There and then was established the feud that lasted so
long and so bitterly. Surrounded by her vassals and
retainers, loud in their wailing for their departed chief, the
widowed wife had thrown herself on the body of her
husband in a paroxysm of wild, uncontrollable grief.</p>
<p>But nought could restore life and animation to that
lowly form. The dead chief lay on his back, with face
up-turned to the sky's blue, which his eyes seemed to
pierce. His bonnet had fallen off, his long yellow hair
floated on the grass, his hand yet grasped the great
claymore, but his tartans were dyed with blood.</p>
<p>Then a brother of the Rae approached and led the
weeping woman gently away. Almost immediately the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
warriors gathered and knelt around the corpse and swore
the terrible feud&mdash;swore eternal enmity to the house of
Coila&mdash;'to fight the clan wherever found, to wrestle, to
rackle and rive with them, and never to make peace</p>

<p>We all know the story of Prince Charlie's expedition,
and how, after victories innumerable, all was lost to his
cause through disunions in his own camps; how his sun
went down on the red field of Culloden Moor; how true
and steadfast, even after defeat, the peasant Highlanders
were to their chief; and how the glens and straths were
devastated by fire and sword; and how the streams ran
red with the innocent blood of old men and children, spilled
by the brutal soldiery of the ruthless duke.</p>
<p>The M'Crimmans lost their estates. The Raes had
never fought for Charlie. Their glen was spared, but the
hopes of M'Rae&mdash;the young chief&mdash;were blighted, for
after years of exile the M'Crimman was pardoned, and
fires were once more lit in the halls of Castle Coila.</p>
<p>Long years went by, many of the Raes went abroad to
fight in foreign lands wherever good swords were needed
and lusty arms to wield them withal; but those who
remained in or near Strathtoul still kept up the feud with
as great fierceness as though it had been sworn but
yesterday.</p>
<p>Towards the beginning of the present century, however,
a strange thing happened. A young officer of French
dragoons came to reside for a time in Glen Coila. His
name was Le Roi. Though of Scotch extraction, he had
never been before to our country. Now hospitality is part
and parcel of the religion of Scotland; it is not surprising,
therefore, that this young son of the sword should have been
received with open arms at Coila, nor that, dashing, handsome,
and brave himself, he should have fallen in love with
the winsome daughter of the then chief of the M'Crimmans.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
When he sought to make her his bride explanations were
necessary. It was no uncommon thing in those days for
good Scotch families to permit themselves to be allied
with France; but there must be rank on both sides. Had
a thunderbolt burst in Castle Coila then it could have
caused no greater commotion than did the fact when it
came to light that Le Roi was a direct descendant of the
chief of the Raes. Alas! for the young lovers now. Le
Roi in silence and sorrow ate his last meal at Castle Coila.
Hospitality had never been shown more liberally than it
was that night, but ere the break of day Le Roi had gone&mdash;never
to return to the glen <i>in propriâ personâ</i>. Whether
or not an aged harper who visited the castle a month
thereafter was Le Roi in disguise may never be known;
but this, at least, is fact&mdash;that same night the chief's
daughter was spirited away and seen no more in Coila.</p>
<p>There was talk, however, of a marriage having been
solemnized by torchlight, in the little Catholic chapel at
the foot of the glen, but of this we will hear more anon,
for thereby hangs a tale.</p>
<p>In course of time Coila presented the sad spectacle of a
house without a head. Who should now be heir? The
Scottish will of former chiefs notified that in event of such
an occurrence the estates should pass 'to the nearest heirs
whatever.'</p>
<p>But was there no heir of direct descent? For a time it
seemed there would be or really was. To wit, a son of Le
Roi, the officer who had wedded into the house of
M'Crimman.</p>
<p>Now our family was brother-family to the M'Crimmans.
M'Crimmans we were ourselves, and Celtic to the last drop
of blood in our veins.</p>
<p>Our claim to the estate was but feebly disputed by the
French Rae's son. His father and mother had years ago
crossed the bourne from which no traveller ever returns,
and he himself was not young. The little church or chapel
in which the marriage had been celebrated was a ruin&mdash;it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
had been burned to the ground, whether as part price of
the terrible feud or not, no one could say; the priest was
dead, or gone none knew whither; and old Mawsie, a
beldame, lived in the cottage that had once been the
Catholic manse.</p>
<p>Those were wild and strange times altogether in this
part of the Scottish Highlands, and law was oftentimes the
property of might rather than right.</p>
<p>At the time, then, our story really opens, my father had
lived in the castle and ruled in the glens for many a long
year. I was the first-born, next came Donald, then Dugald,
and last of all our one sister Flora.</p>
<p>What a happy life was ours in Glen Coila, till the cloud
arose on our horizon, which, gathering force amain, burst
in storm at last over our devoted heads!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>OUR BOYHOOD'S LIFE.</h3>
</div>

<p>On our boyhood's life&mdash;that, I mean, of my brothers and
myself&mdash;I must dwell no longer than the interest of
our strange story demands, for our chapters must soon be
filled with the relation of events and adventures far more
stirring than anything that happened at home in our day.</p>
<p>And yet no truer words were ever spoken than these&mdash;'the
boy is father of the man.' The glorious battle of
Waterloo&mdash;Wellington himself told us&mdash;was won in the
cricket field at home. And in like manner our greatest
pioneers of civilisation, our most successful emigrants,
men who have often literally to lash the rifle to the
plough stilts, as they cultivate and reclaim the land of the
savage, have been made and manufactured, so to speak,
in the green valleys of old England, and on the hills and
moors of bonnie Scotland.</p>
<p>Probably the new M'Crimman of Coila, as my father
was called on the lake side and in the glens, had mingled
more, far more, in life than any chief who had ever reigned
before him. He would not have been averse to drawing
the sword in his country's cause, had it been necessary,
but my brothers and I were born in peaceful times, shortly
after the close of the war with Russia. No, my father
could have drawn the claymore, but he could also use the
ploughshare&mdash;and did.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span></p>
<p>There were at first grumblers in the clans, who lamented
the advent of anything that they were pleased to call
new-fangled. Men there were who wished to live as their
forefathers had done in the 'good old times'&mdash;cultivate
only the tops of the 'rigs,' pasture the sheep and cattle
on the upland moors, and live on milk and meal, and the
fish from the lake, with an occasional hare, rabbit, or bird
when Heaven thought fit to send it.</p>
<p>They were not prepared for my father's sweeping innovations.
They stared in astonishment to see the bare
hillsides planted with sheltering spruce and pine trees; to
see moss and morass turned inside out, drained and made
to yield crops of waving grain, where all was moving bog
before; to see comfortable cottages spring up here and
there, with real stone walls and smiling gardens front
and rear, in place of the turf and tree shielings of
bygone days; and to see a new school-house, where
English&mdash;real English&mdash;was spoken and taught, pour forth
a hundred happy children almost every weekday all the
year round.</p>
<p>This was 'tempting Providence, and no good could come
of it;' so spoke the grumblers, and they wondered indeed
that the old warlike chiefs of M'Crimman did not turn
in their graves. But even the grumblers got fewer and
further between, and at last long peace and plenty reigned
contentedly hand in hand from end to end of Glen Coila,
and all around the loch that was at once the beauty and
pride of our estate.</p>
<p>Improvements were not confined to the crofters'
holdings; they extended to the castle farm and to the
castle itself. Nothing that was old about the latter was
swept away, but much that was new sprang up, and rooms
long untenanted were now restored.</p>
<p>A very ancient and beautiful castle was that of Coila,
with its one huge massive tower, and its dark frowning
embattled walls. It could be seen from far and near, for
even the loch itself was high above the level of the sea.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
I speak of it, be it observed, in the past tense, solely
because I am writing of the past&mdash;of happy days for ever
fled. The castle is still as beautiful&mdash;nay, even more so,
for my aunt's good taste has completed the improvements
my father began.</p>
<p>I do not think any one could have come in contact with
father, as I remember him during our early days at Coila,
without loving and respecting him. He was our hero&mdash;my
brothers' and mine&mdash;so tall, so noble-looking, so
handsome, whether ranging over the heather in autumn
with his gun on his shoulder, or labouring with a hoe or
rake in hand in garden or meadow.</p>
<p>Does it surprise any one to know that even a Highland
chieftain, descended from a long line of warriors, could
handle a hoe as deftly as a claymore? I grant he may
have been the first who ever did so from choice, but was
he demeaned thereby? Assuredly not; and work in the
fields never went half so cheerfully on as when father and
we boys were in the midst of the servants. Our tutor
was a young clergyman, and he, too, used to throw off his
black coat and join us.</p>
<p>At such times it would have done the heart of a cynic
good to have been there; song and joke and hearty laugh
followed in such quick succession that it seemed more like
working for fun than anything else.</p>
<p>And our triumph of triumphs was invariably consummated
at the end of harvest, for then a supper was given
to the tenants and servants. This supper took place in
the great hall of the castle&mdash;the hall that in ancient days
had witnessed many a warlike meeting and Bacchanalian
feast.</p>
<p>Before a single invitation was made out for this event
of the season every sheaf and stook had to be stored and
the stubble raked, every rick in the home barn-yards had
to be thatched and tidied; 'whorls' of turnips had to be
got up and put in pits for the cattle, and even a considerable
portion of the ploughing done.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>'Boys,' my father would say then, pointing with pride
to his lordly stacks of grain and hay, 'Boys,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 2.94334069168506em;'>'"Peace hath her victories,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>No less renowned than war."</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And now,' he would add, 'go and help your tutor to write
out the invitations.'</p>
<p>So kindly-hearted was father that he would even have
extended the right hand of peace and fellowship to the
Raes of Strathtoul. The head of this house, however,
was too proud; yet his pride was of a different kind from
father's. It was of the stand-aloof kind. It was even
rumoured that Le Roi, or Rae, had said at a dinner-party
that my good, dear father brought disgrace on the
warlike name of M'Crimman because he mingled with his
servants in the field, and took a very personal interest in
the welfare of his crofter tenantry.</p>
<p>But my father had different views of life from this
semi-French Rae of Strathtoul. He appreciated the
benefits and upheld the dignity, and even sanctity, of
honest labour. Had he lived in the days of Ancient
Greece, he might have built a shrine to Labour, and
elevated it to the rank of goddess. Only my father
was no heathen, but a plain, God-fearing man, who loved,
or tried to love, his neighbour as himself.</p>
<p>If our father was a hero to us boys, not less so was he
to our darling mother, and to little Sister Flora as well.
So it may be truthfully said that we were a happy family.
The time sped by, the years flew on without, apparently,
ever a bit of change from one Christmas Day to another.
Mr. Townley, our tutor, seemed to have little ambition to
'better himself,' as it is termed. When challenged one
morning at breakfast with his want of desire to push,</p>
<p>'Oh,' said Townley, 'I'm only a young man yet, and
really I do not wish to be any happier than I am. It
will be a grief to me when the boys grow older and go
out into the world and need me no more.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>Mr. Townley was a strict and careful teacher, but by no
means a hard taskmaster. Indoors during school hours he
was the pedagogue all over. He carried etiquette even to
the extent of wearing cap and gown, but these were
thrown off with scholastic duties; he was then&mdash;out of
doors&mdash;as jolly as a schoolboy going to play at his first
cricket-match.</p>
<p>In the field father was our teacher. He taught us, and
the 'grieve,' or bailiff, taught us everything one needs to
know about a farm. Not in headwork alone. No; for,
young as we were at this time, my brothers and I could
wield axe, scythe, hoe, and rake.</p>
<p>We were Highland boys all over, in mind and body,
blood and bone. I&mdash;Murdoch&mdash;was fifteen when the
cloud gathered that finally changed our fortunes. Donald
and Dugald were respectively fourteen and thirteen, and
Sister Flora was eleven.</p>
<p>Big for our years we all were, and I do not think there
was anything on dry land, or on the water either, that we
feared. Mr. Townley used very often to accompany us to
the hills, to the river and lake, but not invariably. We
dearly loved our tutor. What a wonderful piece of
muscularity and good-nature he was, to be sure, as I
remember him! Of both his muscularity and good-nature
I am afraid we often took advantage. Flora invariably
did, for out on the hills she would turn to him with the
utmost <i>sang-froid</i>, saying, 'Townley, I'm tired; take me
on your back.' And for miles Townley would trudge along
with her, feeling her weight no more than if she had been
a moth that had got on his shoulders by accident. There
was no tiring Townley.</p>
<p>To look at our tutor's fair young face, one would never
have given him the credit of possessing a deal of romance,
or believed it possible that he could have harboured any
feeling akin to love. But he did. Now this is a story of
stirring adventure and of struggle, and not a love tale; so
the truth may be as well told in this place as further
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
on&mdash;Townley loved my aunt. It should be remembered that
at this time she was young, but little over twenty, and
in every way she was worthy to be the heroine of a
story.</p>
<p>Townley, however, was no fool. Although he was
admitted to the companionship of every member of our
family, and treated in every respect as an equal, he could
not forget that there was a great gulf fixed between the
humble tutor and the youngest sister of the chief of the
M'Crimmans. If he loved, he kept the secret bound up
in his own breast, content to live and be near the object
of his adoration. Perhaps this hopeless passion of
Townley's had much to do with the formation of his
history.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Those dear old days of boyhood! Even as they were
passing away we used to wish they would last for ever.
Surely that is proof positive that we were very happy,
for is it not common for boys to wish they were men?
We never did.</p>
<p>For we had everything we could desire to make our
little lives a pleasure long drawn out. Boys who were
born in towns&mdash;and we knew many of these, and invited
them occasionally to visit us at our Highland home&mdash;we
used to pity from the bottom of our hearts. How little
they knew about country sports and country life!</p>
<p>One part of our education alone was left to our darling
mother&mdash;namely, Bible history. Oh, how delightful it
used to be to listen to her voice as, seated by our bedside
in the summer evenings, she told us tales from the Book
of Books! Then she would pray with us, for us, and for
father; and sweet and soft was the slumber that soon
visited our pillows.</p>
<p>Looking back now to those dear old days, I cannot help
thinking that the practice of religion as carried on in our
house was more Puritanical in its character than any I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
have seen elsewhere. The Sabbath was a day of such
solemn rest that one lived as it were in a dream. No
food was cooked; even the tables in breakfast-room and
dining-hall were laid on Saturday; no horse left the
stables, the servants dressed in their sombrest and best,
moved about on tiptoe, and talked in whispers. We
children were taught to consider it sinful even to think
our own thoughts on this holy day. If we boys ever
forgot ourselves so far as to speak of things secular, there
was Flora to lift a warning finger and with terrible
earnestness remind us that this was God's day.</p>
<p>From early morn to dewy eve all throughout the
Sabbath we felt as if our footsteps were on the boundaries
of another world&mdash;that kind, loving angels were near
watching all our doings.</p>
<p>I am drawing a true picture of Sunday life in many a
Scottish family, but I would not have my readers mistake
me. Let me say, then, that ours was not a religion of
fear so much as of love. To grieve or vex the great Good
Being who made us and gave us so much to be thankful
for would have been a crime which would have brought
its own punishment by the sorrow and repentance created
in our hearts.</p>
<p>Just one other thing I must mention, because it has
a bearing on events to be related in the next chapter.
We were taught then never to forget that a day of
reckoning was before us all, that after death should
come the judgment. But mother's prayers and our
religion brought us only the most unalloyed happiness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>A TERRIBLE RIDE.</h3>
</div>

<p>I have but to gaze from the window of the tower in
which I am writing to see a whole fieldful of the
daftest-looking long-tailed, long-maned ponies imaginable.
These are the celebrated Castle Coila ponies, as full of
mischief, fun, and fire as any British boy could wish, most
difficult to catch, more difficult still to saddle, and requiring
all the skill of a trained equestrian to manage after mounting.
As these ponies are to-day, so they were when I was a
boy. The very boys whom I mentioned in the last chapter
would have gone anywhere and done anything rather than
attempt to ride a Coila pony. Not that they ever refused,
they were too courageous for that. But when Gilmore led a
pony round, I know it needed all the pluck they could
muster to put foot in stirrup. Flora's advice to them was
not bad.</p>
<p>'There is plenty of room on the moors, boys,' she would
say, laughing; and Flora always brought out the word
'boys' with an air of patronage and self-superiority that
was quite refreshing. 'Plenty of room on the moors, so
you keep the ponies hard at the gallop, till they are quite
tired. Mind, don't let them trot. If you do, they will lie
down and tumble.'</p>
<p>Poor Archie Bateman! I shall never forget his first wild
scamper over the moorland. He would persist in riding in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
his best London clothes, spotless broad white collar, shining
silk hat, gloves, and all. Before mounting he even bent
down to flick a little tiny bit of dust off his boots.</p>
<p>The ponies were fresh that morning. In fact, the word
'fresh' hardly describes the feeling of buoyancy they gave
proof of. For a time it was as difficult to mount one as it
would be for a fly to alight on a top at full spin. We took
them to the paddock, where the grass and moss were soft.
Donald, Dugald, and I held Flora's fiery steed <i>vi et armis</i>
till she got into the saddle.</p>
<p>'Mind to keep them at it, boys,' were her last words, as
she flew out and away through the open gateway. Then
we prepared to follow. Donald, Dugald, and I were used
to tumbles, and for five minutes or more we amused ourselves
by getting up only to get off again. But we were
not hurt. Finally we mounted Archie. His brother was
not going out that morning, and I do believe to this day
that Archie hoped to curry favour with Flora by a little
display of horsemanship, for he had been talking a deal to
her the evening before of the delights of riding in London.</p>
<p>At all events, if he had meant to create a sensation he
succeeded admirably, though at the expense of a portion of
his dignity.</p>
<p>No sooner was he mounted than off he rode. Stay,
though, I should rather say that no sooner did we mount
him than off he was carried. That is a way of putting it
which is more in accordance with facts, for we&mdash;Donald,
Dugald, and I&mdash;mounted him, and the pony did the rest,
he, Archie, being legally speaking <i>nolens volens</i>. When
my brothers and I emerged at last, we could just distinguish
Flora waiting on the horizon of a braeland, her figure
well thrown out against the sky, her pony curveting round
and round, which was Flora's pet pony's way of keeping
still. Away at a tangent from the proper line of march,
Archie on his steed was being rapidly whirled. As soon as
we came within sight of our sister, we observed her making
signs in Archie's direction and concluded to follow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
Having duly signalled her wishes, Flora disappeared over the
brow of the hill. Her intention was, we afterwards found
out, to take a cross-cut and intercept, if possible, the mad
career of Archie's Coila steed.</p>
<p>'Hurry up, Donald,' I shouted to my nearest brother;
'that pony is mad. It is making straight for the cliffs of
Craigiemore.'</p>
<p>On we went at furious speed. It was in reality, or
appeared to be, a race for life; but should we win? The
terrible cliffs for which Archie's pony was heading away
were perpendicular bluffs that rose from a dark slimy morass
near the lake. Fifty feet high they were at the lowest,
and pointed unmistakably to some terrible convulsion of
Nature in ages long gone by. They looked like hills that
had been sawn in half&mdash;one half taken, the other left.</p>
<p>Our ponies were gaining on Archie's. The boy had given
his its head, but it was evident he was now aware of his
danger and was trying to rein in. Trying, but trying in
vain. The pony was in command of the situation.</p>
<p>On&mdash;on&mdash;on they rush. I can feel my heart beating
wildly against my ribs as we all come nigher and nigher to
the cliffs. Donald's pony and Dugald's both overtake me.
Their saddles are empty. My brothers have both been
unhorsed. I think not of that, all my attention is bent
on the rider ahead. If he could but turn his pony's head
even now, he would be saved. But no, it is impossible.
They are on the cliff. There! they are over it, and a wild
scream of terror seems to rend the skies and turn my blood
to water.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span></div>
<p>But lo! I, too, am now in danger. My pony has the bit
fast between his teeth. He means to play at an awful game&mdash;follow
my leader! I feel dizzy; I have forgotten that
I might fling myself off even at the risk of broken bones.
I am close to the cliff&mdash;I&mdash;hurrah! I am saved! Saved
at the very moment when it seemed nothing could save me,
for dear Flora has dashed in front of me&mdash;has cut across
my bows, as sailors would say, striking my pony with all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
the strength of her arm as she is borne along. Saved, yes,
but both on the ground. I extricate myself and get up.
Our ponies are all panting; they appear now to realize the
fearfulness of the danger, and stand together cowed and
quiet. Poor Flora is very pale, and blood is trickling from
a wound in her temple, while her habit is torn and soiled.
We have little time to notice this; we must ride round and
look for the body of poor Archie.</p>
<p>It was a ride of a good mile to reach the cliff foot, but
it took us but a very short time to get round, albeit the
road was rough and dangerous. We had taken our bearings
aright, but for a time we could see no signs of those we
had come to seek. But presently with her riding-whip
Flora pointed to a deep black hole in the slimy bog.</p>
<p>'They are there!' she cried; then burst into a flood of
tears.</p>
<p>We did the best we could to comfort our little sister, and
were all returning slowly, leading our steeds along the
cliff foot, when I stumbled against something lying behind
a tussock of grass.</p>
<p>The something moved and spoke when I bent down. It
was poor Archie, who had escaped from the morass as if by
a miracle.</p>
<p>A little stream was near; it trickled in a half-cataract
down the cliffs. Donald and Dugald hurried away to this
and brought back Highland bonnetfuls of water. Then we
washed Archie's face and made him drink. How we rejoiced
to see him smile again! I believe the London
accent of his voice was at that moment the sweetest music
to Flora she had ever heard in her life.</p>
<p>'What a pwepostewous tumble I've had! How vewy,
<i>vewy</i> stoopid of me to be wun away with!'</p>
<p>Poor Flora laughed one moment at her cousin and cried
the next, so full was her heart. But presently she proved
herself quite a little woman.</p>
<p>'I'll ride on to the castle,' she said, 'and get dry things
ready. You'd better go to bed, Archie, when you come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
home; you are not like a Highland boy, you know. Oh,
I'm so glad you're alive! But&mdash;ha, ha, ha! excuse me&mdash;but
you do look <i>so</i> funny!' and away she rode.</p>
<p>We mounted Archie on Dugald's nag and rode straight
away to the lake. Here we tied our ponies to the birch-trees,
and, undressing, plunged in for a swim. When we
came out we arranged matters thus: Dugald gave Archie
his shirt, Donald gave him a pair of stockings, and I gave
him a cap and my jacket, which was long enough to reach
his knees. We tied the wet things, after washing the slime
off, all in a bundle, and away the procession went to Coila.
Everybody turned out to witness our home-coming. Well,
we did look rather motley, but&mdash;Archie was saved.</p>
<p>My own adventures, however, had not ended yet. Neither
my brothers nor Flora cared to go out again that day,
so in the afternoon I shouldered my fishing rod and went
off to enjoy a quiet hour's sport.</p>
<p>What took my footsteps towards the stream that made
its exit from the loch, and went meandering down the
glen, I never could tell. It was no favourite stream of
mine, for though it contained plenty of trout, it passed
through many woods and dark, gloomy defiles, with here
and there a waterfall, and was on the whole so overhung
with branches that there was difficulty in making a cast.
I was far more successful than I expected to be, however,
and the day wore so quickly away that on looking up I was
surprised to find that the sun had set, and I must be quite
seven miles from home. What did that matter? there
would be a moon! I had Highland legs and a Highland
heart, and knew all the cross-cuts in the country side. I
would try for that big trout that had just leapt up to catch
a moth. It took me half an hour to hook it. But I did,
and after some pretty play I had the satisfaction of landing
a lovely three-pounder. I now reeled up, put my rod in
its canvas case, and prepared to make the best of my way
to the castle.</p>
<p>It was nearly an hour since the sun had gone down like
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
a huge crimson ball in the west, and now slowly over the
hills a veritable facsimile of it was rising, and soon the
stars came out as gloaming gave place to night, and
moonlight flooded all the woods and glen.</p>
<p>The scene around me was lovely, but lonesome in the
extreme, for there was not a house anywhere near, nor a
sound to break the stillness except now and then the
eerisome cry of the brown owl that flitted silently past
overhead. Had I been very timid I could have imagined
that figures were creeping here and there in the flickering
shadows of the trees, or that ghosts and bogles had come
out to keep me company. My nearest way home would
be to cross a bit of heathery moor and pass by the
neglected graveyard and ruined Catholic chapel; and,
worse than all, the ancient manse where lived old
Mawsie.</p>
<p>I never believed that Mawsie was a witch, though
others did. She was said to creep about on moonlight
nights like a dry aisk,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> so people said, 'mooling' among
heaps of rubbish and the mounds over the graves as she
gathered herbs to concoct strange mixtures withal. Certainly
Mawsie was no beauty; she walked 'two-fold,'
leaning on a crutch; she was gray-bearded, wrinkled beyond
conception; her head was swathed winter and
summer in wraps of flannel, and altogether she looked
uncanny. Nevertheless, the peasant people never hesitated
to visit her to beg for herb-tea and oil to rub their
joints. But they always chose the daylight in which to
make their calls.</p>
<p>'Perhaps,' I thought, 'I'd better go round.' Then
something whispered to me, 'What! you a M'Crimman,
and confessing to fear!'</p>
<p>That decided me, and I went boldly on. For the life of
me, however, I could not keep from mentally repeating
those weird and awful lines in Burns' 'Tam o' Shanter,'
descriptive of the hero's journey homewards on that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
unhallowed and awful night when he forgathered with
the witches:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Kirk Alloway seemed in a bleeze.'</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>I almost shuddered as I said to myself, 'What if there
be lights glimmering from the frameless windows of the
ruined chapel? or what if old Mawsie's windows be "in a
bleeze"?'</p>
<p>Tall, ghostly-looking elder-trees grew round the old
manse, which people had told me always kept moving,
even when no breath of wind was blowing.</p>
<p>If I had shuddered before, my heart stood still now with
a nameless dread, for sure enough, from both the 'butt'
and the 'ben' of the so-called witch's cottage lights were
glancing.</p>
<p>What could it mean? She was too old to have company,
almost an invalid, with age alone and its attendant
infirmities&mdash;so, at least, people said. But it had also been
rumoured lately that Mawsie was up to doings which
were far from canny, that lights had been seen flitting
about the old churchyard and ruin, and that something
was sure to happen. Nobody in the parish could have
been found hardy enough to cross the glen-foot where
Mawsie lived long after dark. Well, had I thought of all
this before, it is possible that I might have given her
house a wide berth. It was now too late. I felt like one
in a dream, impelled forward towards the cottage. I
seemed to be walking on the air as I advanced.</p>
<p>To get to the windows, however, I must cross the graveyard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
yard and the ruin. This last was partly covered with tall
rank ivy, and, hearing sounds inside, and seeing the
glimmer of lanterns, I hid in the old porch, quite shaded
by the greenery.</p>
<p>From my concealment I could notice that men were at
work in a vault or pit on the floor of the old chapel, from
which earth and rubbish were being dislodged, while
another figure&mdash;not that of a workman&mdash;was bending
over and addressing them in English. It was evident,
therefore, those people below were not Highlanders, for in
the face of the man who spoke I was able at a glance to
distinguish the hard-set lineaments of the villain Duncan
M'Rae. This man had been everything in his time&mdash;soldier,
school-teacher, poacher, thief. He was abhorred
by his own clan, and feared by every one. Even the school
children, if they met him on the road, would run back to
avoid him.</p>
<p>Duncan had only recently come back to the glen after
an absence of years, and every one said his presence boded
no good. I shuddered as I gazed, almost spellbound, on
his evil countenance, rendered doubly ugly in the uncertain
light of the lantern. Suppose he should find me! I crept
closer into my corner now, and tried to draw the ivy round
me. I dared not run, for fear of being seen, for the moonlight
was very bright indeed, and M'Rae held a gun in his
hand.</p>
<p>After a time, which appeared to be interminable, I
heard Duncan invite the men into supper, and slowly they
clambered up out of the pit, and the three prepared to
leave together.</p>
<p>All might have been well now, for they passed me without
even a glance in my direction; but presently I heard
one of the men stumble.</p>
<p>'Hullo!' he said; 'is this basket of fish yours, Mr.
Mac?'</p>
<p>'No,' was the answer, with an imprecation that made me
quake. 'We are watched!'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span></p>
<p>In another moment I was dragged from my place of
concealment, and the light was held up to my face.</p>
<p>'A M'Crimman of Coila, by all that is furious! And
so, youngster, you've come to watch? You know the
family feud, don't you? Well, prepare to meet your doom.
You'll never leave here alive.'</p>
<p>He pointed his gun at me as he spoke.</p>
<p>'Hold!' cried one of the men. 'We came from town
to do a bit of honest work, but we will not witness
murder.'</p>
<p>'I only wanted to frighten him,' said M'Rae, lowering
his gun. 'Look you, sir,' he continued, addressing me
once more, 'I don't want revenge, even on a M'Crimman
of Coila. I'm a poacher; perhaps I'm a distiller in a quiet
way. No matter, you know what an oath is. You'll
swear ere you leave here, not to breathe a word of what
you've seen. You hear?'</p>
<p>'I promise I won't,' I faltered.</p>
<p>He handled his fowling-piece threateningly once again.
Verily, he had just then a terribly evil look.</p>
<p>'I swear,' I said, with trembling lips.</p>
<p>His gun was again lowered. He seemed to breathe
more freely&mdash;less fiercely.</p>
<p>'Go, now,' he said, pointing across the moor. 'If a poor
man like myself wants to hide either his game or his
private still, what odds is it to a M'Crimman of Coila?'</p>
<p>How I got home I never knew. I remember that evening
being in our front drawing-room with what seemed a
sea of anxious faces round me, some of which were bathed
in tears. Then all was a long blank, interspersed with
fearful dreams.</p>
<p>It was weeks before I recovered consciousness. I was
then lying in bed. In at the open window was wafted
the odour of flowers, for it was a summer's evening, and
outside were the green whispering trees. Townley sat
beside the bed, book in hand, and almost started when I
spoke.</p>

<p>'Mr. Townley!'</p>
<p>'Yes, dear boy.'</p>
<p>'Have I been long ill?'</p>
<p>'For weeks&mdash;four, I think. How glad I am you are
better! But you must keep very, <i>very</i> quiet. I shall go
and bring your mother now, and Flora.'</p>
<p>I put out my thin hand and detained him.</p>
<p>'Tell me, Mr. Townley,' I said, 'have I spoken much in
my sleep, for I have been dreaming such foolish dreams?'</p>
<p>Townley looked at me long and earnestly. He seemed
to look me through and through. Then he replied slowly,
almost solemnly,</p>
<p>'Yes, dear boy, you have spoken <i>much</i>.'</p>
<p>I closed my eyes languidly. For now I knew that
Townley was aware of more than ever I should have dared
to reveal.

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>THE RING AND THE BOOK.</h3>
</div>

<p>My return to health was a slow though not a painful
one. My mind, however, was clear, and even before
I could partake of food I enjoyed hearing sister play to me
on her harp. Sometimes aunt, too, would play. My
mother seldom left the room by day, and one of my chief
delights was her stories from Bible life and tales of Bible
lands.</p>
<p>At last I was permitted to get up and recline in fauteuil
or on sofa.</p>
<p>'Mother,' I said one day, 'I feel getting stronger, but
somehow I do not regain spirits. Is there some sorrow in
your heart, mother, or do I only imagine it?'</p>
<p>She smiled, but there were tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>'I'm sure we are all very, <i>very</i> happy, Murdoch, to have
you getting well again.'</p>
<p>'And, mother,' I persisted, 'father does not seem easy
in mind either. He comes in and talks to me, but often I
think his mind is wandering to other subjects.'</p>
<p>'Foolish child! nothing could make your father unhappy.
He does his duty by us all, and his faith is fixed.'</p>
<p>One day they came and told me that the doctor had
ordered me away to the seaside. Mother and Flora were
to come, and one servant; the rest of our family were to
follow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span></p>
<p>It was far away south to Rothesay we went, and here,
my cheeks fanned by the delicious sea-breezes, I soon
began to grow well and strong again. But the sorrow in
my mother's face was more marked than ever, though I
had ceased to refer to it.</p>
<p>The rooms we had hired were very pleasant, but looked
very small in comparison with the great halls I had been
used to.</p>
<p>Well, on a beautiful afternoon father and my brothers
arrived, and we all had tea out on the shady lawn, up to
the very edge of which the waves were lapping and
lisping.</p>
<p>I was reclining in a hammock chair, listening to the
sea's soft, soothing murmur, when father brought his
camp-stool and sat near me.</p>
<p>'Murdoch, boy,' he said, taking my hand gently, almost
tenderly, in his, 'are you strong enough to bear bad
news?'</p>
<p>My heart throbbed uneasily, but I replied, bravely
enough, 'Yes, dear father; yes.'</p>
<p>'Then,' he said, speaking very slowly, as if to mark the
effect of every word, 'we are&mdash;never&mdash;to return&mdash;to Castle
Coila!'</p>
<p>I was calm now, for, strange to say, the news appeared
to be no news at all.</p>
<p>'Well, father,' I answered, cheerfully, 'I can bear that&mdash;I
could bear anything but separation.'</p>
<p>I went over and kissed my mother and sister.</p>
<p>'So this is the cloud that was in your faces, eh? Well,
the worst is over. I have nothing to do now but get well.
Father, I feel quite a man.'</p>
<p>'So do we both feel men,' said Donald and Dugald;
'and we are all going to work. Won't that be jolly?'</p>
<p>In a few brief words father then explained our position.
There had arrived one day, some weeks after the worst
and most dangerous part of my illness was over, an
advocate from Aberdeen, in a hired carriage. He had, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
said, a friend with him, who seemed, so he worded it, 'like
one risen from the dead.'</p>
<p>His friend was helped down, and into father's private
room off the hall.</p>
<p>His friend was the old beldame Mawsie, and a short but
wonderful story she had to tell, and did tell, the Aberdeen
advocate sitting quietly by the while with a bland smile on
his face. She remembered, she said with many a sigh and
groan, and many a doleful shake of head and hand, the
marriage of Le Roi the dragoon with the Miss M'Crimman
of Coila, although but a girl at the time; and she
remembered, among many other things, that the priest's
books were hidden for safety in a vault, where he also kept
all the money he possessed. No one knew of the existence
of this vault except her, and so on and so forth. So
voluble did the old lady become that the advocate had to
apply the <i>clôture</i> at last.</p>
<p>'It is strange&mdash;if true,' my father had muttered.
'Why,' he added, 'had the old lady not spoken of this
before?'</p>
<p>'Ah, yes, to be sure,' said the Aberdonian. 'Well, that
also is strange, but easily explained. The shock received
on the night of the fire at the chapel had deprived the poor
soul of memory. For years and years this deprivation
continued, but one day, not long ago, the son of the present
claimant, and probably rightful heir, to Coila walked into
her room at the old manse, gun in hand. He had been
down shooting at Strathtoul, and naturally came across to
view the ruin so intimately connected with his father's fate
and fortune. No sooner had he appeared than the good
old dame rushed towards him, calling him by his
grandfather's name. Her memory had returned as
suddenly as it had gone. She had even told him of the
vault. 'Perhaps,' continued he, with a meaning smile,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>'"'Tis the sunset of life gives her mystical lore,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>And coming events cast their shadow before."'</p>
</td></tr></table>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>A fortnight after this visit a meeting of those concerned
took place at the beldame's house. She herself pointed to
the place where she thought the vault lay, and with all
due legal formality digging was commenced, and the place
was found not far off. At first glance the vault seemed
empty. In one corner, however, was found, covered lightly
over with withered ferns, many bottles of wine and&mdash;a box.
The two men of law, Le Roi's solicitor and M'Crimman's,
had a little laugh all to themselves over the wine. Legal
men will laugh at anything.</p>
<p>'The priest must have kept a good cellar on the sly,'
one said.</p>
<p>'That is evident,' replied the other.</p>
<p>The box was opened with some little difficulty. In it
was a book&mdash;an old Latin Bible. But something else was
in it too. Townley was the first to note it. Only a silver
ring such as sailors wear&mdash;a ring with a little heart-shaped
ruby stone in it. Book and ring were now sealed up in
the box, and next day despatched to Edinburgh with all
due formality. The best legal authorities the Scotch
metropolis could boast of were consulted on both sides, but
fate for once was against the M'Crimmans of Coila. The
book told its tale. Half-carelessly written on fly-leaves,
but each duly dated and signed by Stewart, the priest, were
notes concerning many marriages, Le Roi's among the
rest.</p>
<p>Even M'Crimman himself confessed that he was satisfied&mdash;as
was every one else save Townley.</p>
<p>'The book has told one tale&mdash;or rather its binding has,'
said Townley; 'but the ring may yet tell another.'</p>
<p>All this my father related to me that evening as we sat
together on the lawn by the beach of Rothesay.</p>
<p>When he had finished I sat silently gazing seawards, but
spoke not. My brothers told me afterwards that I looked
as if turned to stone. And, indeed, indeed, my heart felt
so. When father first told me we should go back no more
to Coila I felt almost happy that the bad news was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
worse; but now that explanations had followed, my
perplexity was extreme.</p>
<p>One thing was sure and certain&mdash;there was a conspiracy,
and the events of that terrible night at the ruin had to do
with it. The evil man Duncan M'Rae was in it. Townley
suspected it from words I must have let fall in my
delirium; but, worst of all, my mouth was sealed. Oh,
why, why did I not rather die than be thus bound!</p>
<p>It must be remembered that I was very young, and knew
not then that an oath so forced upon me could not be
binding.</p>
<p>Come weal, come woe, however, I determined to keep
my word.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The scene of our story changes now to Edinburgh itself.
Here we had all gone to live in a house owned by aunt,
not far from the Calton Hill. We were comparatively poor
now, for father, with the honour and Christian feeling that
ever characterized him, had even paid up back rent to the
new owner of Coila Castle and Glen.</p>
<p>That parting from Coila had been a sad one. I was not
there&mdash;luckily for me, perhaps; but Townley has told me
of it often and often.</p>
<p>'Yes, Murdoch M'Crimman,' he said, 'I have been
present at the funeral of many a Highland chief, but none
of these impressed me half so much as the scene in Glen
Coila, when the carriage containing your dear father and
mother and Flora left the old castle and wound slowly
down the glen. Men, women, and little ones joined in
procession, and marched behind it, and so followed on and
on till they reached the glen-foot, with the bagpipes
playing "Farewell to Lochaber." This affected your father
as much, I think, as anything else. As for your mother,
she sat silently weeping, and Flora dared hardly trust
herself to look up at all. Then the parting! The chief,
your father, stood up and addressed his people&mdash;for "his
people" he still would call them. There was not a tremor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
in his voice, nor was there, on the other hand, even a spice
of bravado. He spoke to them calmly, logically. In the
old days, he said, might had been right, and many a gallant
corps of heroes had his forefathers led from the glen, but
times had changed. They were governed by good laws,
and good laws meant fair play, for they protected all alike,
gentle and simple, poor as well as rich. He bade them
love and honour the new chief of Coila, to whom, as his
proven right, he not only heartily transferred his lands and
castle, but even, as far as possible, the allegiance of his
people. They must be of good cheer, he said; he would
never forget the happy time he had spent in Coila, and if
they should meet no more on this earth, there was a
Happier Land beyond death and the grave. He ended his
brief oration with that little word which means so much,
"Good-bye." But scarcely would they let him go. Old,
bare-headed, white-haired men crowded round the carriage
to bless their chief and press his hand; tearful women held
children up that he might but touch their hair, while some
had thrown themselves on the heather in paroxysms of a
grief which was uncontrollable. Then the pipes played
once more as the carriage drove on, while the voices of the
young men joined in chorus&mdash;</p>

<p>'When,' added Townley, 'a bend of the road and the
drooping birch-trees shut out the mournful sight, I am sure
we all felt relieved. Your father, smiling, extended his
hand to your mother, and she fondled it and wept no more.'</p>

<p>For a time our life, to all outward seeming, was now a
very quiet one. Although Donald and Dugald were sent
to that splendid seminary which has given so many great
men and heroes to the world, the 'High School of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
Edinburgh,' Townley still lived on with us as my tutor
and Flora's.</p>
<p>What my father seemed to suffer most from was the
want of something at which to employ his time, and what
Townley called his 'talent for activity.' 'Doing nothing'
was not father's form after leading so energetic a life for
so many years at Coila. Like the city of Boston in
America, Edinburgh prides itself on the selectness of its
society. To this, albeit we had come down in the world,
pecuniarily speaking, our family had free <i>entrée</i>. This
would have satisfied some men; it did not satisfy father.
He missed the bracing mountain air, he missed the
freedom of the hills and the glorious exercise to which he
had been accustomed.</p>
<p>He missed it, but he mourned it not. His was the most
unselfish nature one could imagine. Whatever he may
have felt in the privacy of his own apartment, however
much he may have sorrowed in silence, among us he was
ever cheerful and even gay. Perhaps, on the whole, it
may seem to some that I write or speak in terms too
eulogistic. But it should not be forgotten that the
M'Crimman was my father, and that he is&mdash;gone. <i>De
mortuis nil nisi bonum.</i></p>
<p>The ex-chief of Coila was a gentleman. And what a
deal there is in that one wee word! No one can ape the
gentleman. True gentlemanliness must come from the
heart; the heart is the well from which it must spring&mdash;constantly,
always, in every position of life, and wherever
the owner may be. No amount of exterior polish can
make a true gentleman. The actor can play the part on
the stage, but here he is but acting, after all. Off the
stage he may or may not be the gentleman, for then he
must not be judged by his dress, by his demeanour in
company, his calmness, or his ducal bow, but by his actions,
his words, or his spoken thoughts.</p>

<p>About a year after our arrival in Edinburgh, Townley
was seated one day midway up the beautiful mountain
called Arthur's Seat. It was early summer; the sky was
blue and almost cloudless; far beneath, the city of palaces
and monuments seemed to sleep in the sunshine; away to
the east lay the sea, blue even as the sky itself, except
where here and there a cloud shadow passed slowly over
its surface. Studded, too, was the sea with many a white
sail, and steamers with trailing wreaths of smoke.</p>
<p>The noise of city life, faint and far, fell on the ear with
a hum hardly louder than the murmur of the insects and
bees that sported among the wild flowers.</p>
<p>Townley would not have been sitting here had he been
all by himself, for this Herculean young parson never yet
set eye on a hill he meant to climb without going straight
to the top of it.</p>
<p>'There is no tiring Townley.' I have often heard father
make that remark; and, indeed, it gave in a few words a
complete clue to Townley's character.</p>
<p>But to-day my aunt Cecilia was with him, and it was
on her account he was resting. They had been sitting for
some time in silence.</p>
<p>'It is almost too lovely a day for talking,' she said, at
last.</p>
<p>'True; it is a day for thinking and dreaming.'</p>
<p>'I do not imagine, sir, that either thinking or dreaming
is very much in your way.'</p>
<p>He turned to her almost sharply.</p>
<p>'Oh, indeed,' he said, 'you hardly gauge my character
aright, Miss M'Crimman.'</p>
<p>'Do I not?'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>'No, if you only knew how much I think at times;
if you only knew how much I have even dared to
dream&mdash;'</p>
<p>There was a strange meaning in his looks if not in his
words. Did she interpret either aright, I wonder? I
know not. Of one thing I am sure, and that is, my friend
and tutor was far too noble to seem to take advantage of
my aunt's altered circumstances in life to press his suit.
He might be her equal some day, at present he was&mdash;her
brother's guest and domestic.</p>
<p>'Tell me,' she said, interrupting him, 'some of your
thoughts; dreams at best are silly.'</p>
<p>He heaved the faintest sigh, and for a few moments
appeared bent only on forming an isosceles triangle of
pebbles with his cane.</p>
<p>Then he put his fingers in his pocket.</p>
<p>'I wish to show you,' he said, 'a ring.'</p>
<p>'A ring, Mr. Townley! What a curious ring! Silver,
set with a ruby heart. Why, this is the ring&mdash;the
mysterious ring that belonged to the priest, and was found
in his box in the vault.'</p>
<p>'No, that is not <i>the</i> ring. <i>The</i> ring is in a safe and
under seal. That is but a facsimile. But, Miss M'Crimman,
the ring in question did not, I have reason to believe,
belong to the priest Stewart, nor was it ever worn by
him.'</p>
<p>'How strangely you talk and look, Mr. Townley!'</p>
<p>'Whatever I say to you now, Miss M'Crimman, I wish
you to consider sacred.'</p>
<p>The lady laughed, but not lightly.</p>
<p>'Do you think,' she said, 'I can keep a secret?'</p>
<p>'I do, Miss M'Crimman, and I want a friend and
occasional adviser.'</p>
<p>'Go on, Mr. Townley. You may depend on me.'</p>
<p>'All we know, or at least all he will tell us of Murdoch's&mdash;your
nephew's&mdash;illness, is that he was frightened at the
ruin that night. He did not lead us to infer&mdash;for this boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
is honest&mdash;that the terror partook of the supernatural, but
he seemed pleased we did so infer.'</p>
<p>'Yes, Mr. Townley.'</p>
<p>'I watched by his bedside at night, when the fever was
at its hottest. I alone listened to his ravings. Such
ravings have always, so doctors tell us, a foundation in
fact. He mentioned this ring over and over again. He
mentioned a vault; he mentioned a name, and starting
sometimes from uneasy slumber, prayed the owner of that
name to spare him&mdash;to shoot him not.'</p>
<p>'And from this you deduce&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'From this,' said Townley, 'I deduce that poor Murdoch
had seen that ring on the left hand of a villain who had
threatened to shoot him, for some potent reason or another,
that Murdoch had seen that vault open, and that he has
been bound down by sacred oath not to reveal what he
did see.'</p>
<p>'But oh, Mr. Townley, such oath could not, cannot be
binding on the boy. We must&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'No, we must <i>not</i>, Miss M'Crimman. We must not put
pressure on Murdoch at present. We must not treat
lightly his honest scruples. <i>You</i> must leave <i>me</i> to work
the matter out in my own way. Only, whenever I need
your assistance or friendship to aid me, I may ask for it,
may I not?'</p>
<p>'Indeed you may, Mr. Townley.'</p>
<p>Her hand lay for one brief moment in his; then they
got up silently and resumed their walk.</p>
<p>Both were thinking now.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>A NEW HOME IN THE WEST.</h3>
</div>

<p>To-night, before I entered my tower-room study and
sat down to continue our strange story, I was leaning
over the battlements and gazing admiringly at the
beautiful sunset effects among the hills and on the lake,
when my aunt came gliding to my side. She always
comes in this spirit-like way.</p>
<p>'May I say one word,' she said, 'without interrupting
the train of your thoughts?'</p>
<p>'Yes, dear aunt,' I replied; 'speak as you please&mdash;say
what you will.'</p>
<p>'I have been reading your manuscript, Murdoch, and I
think it is high time you should mention that the M'Raes
of Strathtoul were in no degree connected with or
voluntarily mixed up in the villainy that banished your
poor father from Castle Coila.'</p>
<p>'It shall be as you wish,' I said, and then Aunt Cecilia
disappeared as silently as she had come.</p>
<p>Aunt is right. Nor can I forget that&mdash;despite the long-lasting
and unfortunate blood-feud&mdash;the Strathtouls were
and are our kinsmen. It is due to them to add that they
ever acted honourably, truthfully; that there was but one
villain, and whatever of villainy was transacted was his.
Need I say his name was Duncan M'Rae? A M'Rae of
Strathtoul? No; I am glad and proud to say he was not.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
I even doubt if he had any right or title to the name at
all. It may have been but an <i>alias</i>. An <i>alias</i> is often of
the greatest use to such a man as this Duncan; so is an
<i>alibi</i> at times!</p>
<p>I have already mentioned the school in the glen which
my father the chief had built. M'Rae was one of its
first teachers. He was undoubtedly clever, and, though
he had not come to Coila without a little cloud on his
character, his plausibility and his capability prevailed upon
my father to give him a chance. There used at that time
to be services held in the school on Sunday evenings, to
which the most humbly dressed peasant could come.
Humble though they were, they invariably brought their
mite for the collection. It was dishonesty&mdash;even
sacrilegious dishonesty&mdash;in Duncan to appropriate such
moneys to his use, and to falsify the books. It is needless
to say he was dismissed, and ever after he bore little
good-will to the M'Crimmans of Coila.</p>
<p>He had now to live on his wits. His wits led him to
dishonesty of a different sort&mdash;he became a noted poacher.
His quarrels with the glen-keepers often led to ugly
fights and to bloodshed, but never to Duncan's reform.
He lived and lodged with old Mawsie. It suited him to
do so for several reasons, one of which was that she had,
as I have already said, an ill-name, and the keepers were
superstitious; besides, her house was but half a mile from
a high road, along which a carrier passed once a week on
his way to a distant town, and Duncan nearly always had
a mysterious parcel for him.</p>
<p>The poacher wanted a safe or store for his ill-gotten
game. What better place than the floor of the ruined
church? While digging there, to his surprise he had
discovered a secret vault or cell; the roof and sides had
fallen in, but masons could repair them. Such a place
would be invaluable in his craft if it could be kept secret,
and he determined it should be. After this, strange lights
were said to be seen sometimes by belated travellers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
flitting among the old graves; twice also a ghost had been
met on the hill adjoining&mdash;some <i>thing</i> at least that
disappeared immediately with eldritch scream.</p>
<p>It was shortly after this that Duncan had imported two
men to do what they called 'a bit of honest work.'
Duncan had lodged and fed them at Mawsie's; they
worked at night, and when they had done the 'honest
work,' he took them to Invergowen and shipped them back
to Aberdeen.</p>
<p>But the poacher's discovery of the priest's Bible turned
his thoughts to a plan of enriching himself far more
effectually and speedily than he ever could expect to do by
dealing in game without a licence.</p>
<p>At the same time Duncan had found the poor priest's
modest store of wine. A less scientific villain would have
made short work with this, but the poacher knew better at
present than to 'put an enemy in his mouth to steal away
his brains;' besides, the vault would look more natural,
when afterwards 'discovered,' with a collection of old bottles
of wine in it.</p>
<p>To forge an entry on one of the fly-leaves of the book
was no difficult task, nor was it difficult to deal with
Mawsie so as to secure the end he had in view in the
most natural way. Once again his villain-wit showed its
ascendency. A person of little acumen would have sought
to work upon the old lady's greed&mdash;would have tried to
bribe her to say this or that, or to swear to anything.
But well Duncan knew how treacherous is the aged
memory, and yet how easily acted on. He began by talking
much about the Le Roi marriage which had taken place
when she was a girl. He put words in the old lady's
mouth without seeming to do so; he manufactured an
artificial memory for her, and neatly fitted it.</p>
<p>'Surely, mother,' he would say, 'you remember the
marriage that took place in the chapel at midnight&mdash;the
rich soldier, you know, Le Roi, and the bonnie M'Crimman
lady? You're not so <i>very</i> old as to forget that.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>'Heigho! it's a long time ago, <i>ma yhillie og</i>, a long
time ago, and I was young.'</p>
<p>'True, but old people remember things that happened
when they were young better than more recent events.'</p>
<p>They talked in Gaelic, so I am not giving their exact
words.</p>
<p>'Ay, ay, lad&mdash;ay, ay! And, now that you mention it, I
do remember it well&mdash;the lassie M'Crimman and the bonnie,
bonnie gentleman.'</p>
<p>'Gave you a guinea&mdash;don't you remember?'</p>
<p>'Ay, ay, the dear man!'</p>
<p>'Is this it?' continued Duncan, holding up a golden
coin.</p>
<p>Her eyes gloated over the money, her birdlike claw
clutched it; she 'crooned' over it, sang to it, rolled it in a
morsel of flannel, and put it away in her bosom.</p>
<p>A course of this kind of tuition had a wonderful effect
on Mawsie. After the marriage came the vault, and she
soon remembered all that. But probably the guinea had
more effect than anything else in fixing her mind on the
supposed events of the past.</p>
<p>You see, Duncan was a psychologist, and a good one,
too. Pity he did not turn his talents to better use.</p>
<p>The poacher's next move was to hurry up to London,
and obtain an interview with the chief of Strathtoul's son.
He seldom visited Scotland, being an officer of the Guards&mdash;a
soldier, as his grandfather had been.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Duncan M'Rae's plausible story
found a ready listener in young Le Roi, or that he was
only too happy to pay the poacher a large but reasonable
sum for proofs which should place his father in possession
of fortune and a fine estate?</p>
<p>The rest was easy. A large coloured sketch was shown
to old Mawsie as a portrait of the Le Roi who had been
married in the old chapel in her girlhood. It was that of
his grandson, who shortly after visited the manse and the
ruin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></p>
<p>Duncan was successful beyond his utmost expectations.
Only 'the wicked flee when no man pursueth' them, and
this villain could not feel easy while he remained at home.
Two things preyed on his mind&mdash;first, the meeting with
myself at the ruin; secondly, the loss of his ring.
Probably had the two men not interfered that night he
would have made short work of me. As for the ring, he
blamed his own carelessness for losing it. It was a dead
man's ring; would it bring him ill-luck?</p>
<p>So he fled&mdash;or departed&mdash;put it as you please; but,
singular to say, old Mawsie was found dead in her house
the day <i>after</i> he had been seen to take his departure from
the glen. It was said she had met her death by
premeditated violence; but who could have slain the poor
old crone, and for what reason? It was more charitable
and more reasonable to believe that she had fallen and
died where she was found. So the matter had been
allowed to rest. What could it matter to Mawsie?</p>
<p>Townley alone had different and less charitable views
about the matter. Meanwhile Townley's bird had flown.
But everything comes to him who can wait, and&mdash;there
was no tiring Townley.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>A year or two flew by quickly enough. I know what
that year or two did for me&mdash;<i>it made me a man!</i></p>
<p>Not so much in stature, perhaps&mdash;I was young, barely
seventeen&mdash;but a man in mind, in desire, in ambition, and
in brave resolve. Do not imagine that I had been very
happy since leaving Coila; my mind was racked by a
thousand conflicting thoughts that often kept me awake at
night when all others were sunk in slumber. Something
told me that the doings of that night at the ruin had
undone our fortunes, and I was bound by solemn promise
never to divulge what I had seen or what I knew. A
hundred times over I tried to force myself to the belief
that the poacher was only a poacher, and not a villain of
deeper dye, but all in vain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>Time, however, is the <i>edax rerum</i>&mdash;the devourer of all
things, even of grief and sorrow. Well, I saw my father
and mother and Flora happy in their new home, content
with their new surroundings, and I began to take heart.
But to work I must go. What should I do? What should
I be? The questions were answered in a way I had little
dreamt of.</p>
<p>One evening, about eight o'clock, while passing along a
street in the new town, I noticed well-dressed mechanics and
others filing into a hall, where, it was announced, a lecture
was to be delivered&mdash;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>'<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>A New Home in the West.</span>'</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Such was the heading of the printed bills. Curiosity
led me to enter with others.</p>
<p>I listened entranced. The lecture was a revelation to
me. The 'New Home in the West' was the Argentine
Republic, and the speaker was brimful of his subject, and
brimful to overflowing with the rugged eloquence that
goes straight to the heart.</p>
<p>There was wealth untold in the silver republic for those
who were healthy, young, and willing to work&mdash;riches
enough to be had for the digging to buy all Scotland up&mdash;riches
of grain, of fruit, of spices, of skins and wool and
meat&mdash;wealth all over the surface of the new home&mdash;wealth
<i>in</i> the earth and bursting through it&mdash;wealth and
riches everywhere.</p>
<p>And beauty everywhere too&mdash;beauty of scenery, beauty
of woods and wild flowers; of forest stream and sunlit skies.
Why stay in Scotland when wealth like this was to be had
for the gathering? England was a glorious country, but
its very over-population rendered it a poor one, and poorer
it was growing every day.</p>

<p>Language like this was to me simply intoxicating. I
talked all next day about what I had heard, and when
evening came I once more visited the lecture-hall, this
time in company with my brothers.</p>
<p>'Oh,' said Donald, as we were returning home, 'that
is the sort of work we want.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' cried Dugald the younger; 'and that is the land
to go to.'</p>
<p>'You are so young&mdash;sixteen and fifteen&mdash;I fear I cannot
take you with me,' I put in.</p>
<p>Donald stopped short in the street and looked straight
in my face.</p>
<p>'So <i>you</i> mean to go, then? And you think you can go
without Dugald and me? Young, are we? But won't we
grow out of that? We are not town-bred brats. Feel my
arm; look at brother's lusty legs! And haven't we both
got hearts&mdash;the M'Crimman heart? Ho, ho, Murdoch!
big as you are, you don't go without Dugald and me!'</p>
<p>'That he sha'n't!' said Dugald, determinedly.</p>
<p>'Come on up to the top of the craig,' I said; 'I want a
walk. It is only half-past nine.'</p>
<p>But it was well-nigh eleven before we three brothers
had finished castle-building.</p>
<p>Remember, it was not castles in the air, either, we were
piling up. We had health, strength, and determination,
with a good share of honest ambition; and with these we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
believed we could gather wealth. The very thoughts of
doing so filled me with a joy that was inexpressible. Not
that I valued money for itself, but because wealth, if I
could but gain it, would enable me to in some measure
restore the fortunes of our fallen house.</p>
<p>We first consulted father. It was not difficult to secure
his acquiescence to our scheme, and he even told mother
that it was unnatural to expect birds to remain always in
the parent nest.</p>
<p>I have no space to detail all the outs and ins of our
arguments; suffice it to say they were successful, and
preparations for our emigration were soon commenced.
One stipulation of dear mother's we were obliged to give
in to&mdash;namely, that Aunt Cecilia should go with us.
Aunt was very wise, though very romantic withal&mdash;a
strange mixture of poetry and common-sense. My father
and mother, however, had very great faith in her.
Moreover, she had already travelled all by herself half-way
over the world. She had therefore the benefit of former
experiences. But in every way we were fain to admit
that aunt was eminently calculated to be our friend and
mentor. She was and is clever. She could talk philosophy
to us, even while darning our stockings or seeing after our
linen; she could talk half a dozen languages, but she could
talk common-sense to the cook as well; she was fitted to
mix in the very best society, but she could also mix a
salad. She played entrancingly on the harp, sang well,
recited Ossian's poems by the league, had a beautiful face,
and the heart of a lion, which well became the sister of a
chief.</p>
<p>It is only fair to add that it was aunt who found the
sinews of war&mdash;our war with fortune. She, however, made
a sacrifice to our pride in promising to consider any and all
moneys spent upon us as simply loans, to be repaid with
interest when we grew rich, if not&mdash;and this was only an
honest stipulation&mdash;worked off beforehand.</p>
<p>But poor dear aunt, her love of travel and adventure was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
quite wonderful, and she had a most childlike faith in the
existence and reality of the El Dorado we were going in
search of.</p>
<p>The parting with father, mother, and Flora was a terrible
trial. I can hardly think of it yet without a feeling akin to
melancholy. But we got away at last amid prayers and
blessings and tears. A hundred times over Flora had
begged us to write every week, and to make haste and get
ready a place for her and mother and father and all in our
new home in the West, for she would count the days until
the summons came to follow.</p>
<p>Fain would honest, brawny Townley have gone with us.
What an acquisition he would have proved! only, he told
me somewhat significantly, he had work to do, and if he
was successful he might follow on. I know, though, that
parting with Aunt Cecilia almost broke his big brave
heart.</p>
<p>There was so much to do when we arrived in London,
from which port we were to sail, so much to buy, so much
to be seen, and so many people to visit, that I and my
brothers had little time to revert even to the grief of
parting from all we held dear at home.</p>
<p>We did not forget to pay a visit to our forty-second
cousins in their beautiful and aristocratic mansion at the
West End. Archie Bateman was our favourite. My
brothers and I were quite agreed as to that. The other
cousin&mdash;who was also the elder&mdash;was far too much
swamped in <i>bon ton</i> to please Highland lads such as we
were.</p>
<p>But over and over again Archie made us tell him all we
knew or had heard of the land we were going to. The first
night Archie had said,</p>
<p>'Oh, I wish I were going too!'</p>
<p>The second evening his remark was,</p>
<p>'Why <i>can't</i> I go?'</p>
<p>But on the third and last day of our stay Archie took
me boldly by the hand&mdash;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>'Don't tell anybody,' he said, 'but I'm going to follow
you very soon. Depend upon that. I'm only a younger
son. Younger sons are nobodies in England. The eldest
sons get all the pudding, and we have only the dish to
scrape. They talk about making me a barrister. I don't
mean to be made a barrister; I'd as soon be a bumbailiff.
No, I'm going to follow you, cousin, so I sha'n't say good-bye&mdash;just
<i>au revoir</i>.'</p>
<p>And when we drove away from the door, I really could
not help admiring the handsome bold-looking English lad
who stood in the porch waving his handkerchief and
shouting,</p>
<p>'<i>Au revoir&mdash;au revoir.</i>'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>THE PROMISED LAND AT LAST.</h3>
</div>

<p>'There is nothing more annoyin' than a hitch at the
hin'eren'. What think you, young sir?'</p>
<p>'I beg pardon,' I replied, 'but I'm afraid I did not
quite understand you.'</p>
<p>I had been standing all alone watching our preparations
for dropping down stream with the tide. What a wearisome
time it had been, too!</p>
<p>The Canton was advertised to sail the day before, but
did not. We were assured, however, she would positively
start at midnight, and we had gone to bed expecting to
awake at sea. I had fallen asleep brimful of all kinds of
romantic thoughts. But lo! I had been awakened early
on the dark morning of this almost wintry day with the
shouting of men, the rattling of chains, and puff-puff-puffing
of that dreadful donkey-engine.</p>
<p>'Oh yes, we'll be off, sure enough, about eight bells.'</p>
<p>This is what the steward told us after breakfast, but all
the forenoon had slipped away, and here we still were.
The few people on shore who had stayed on, maugre wind
and sleet, to see the very, <i>very</i> last of friends on board,
looked very worn and miserable.</p>
<p>But surely we were going at last, for everything was
shipped and everything was comparatively still&mdash;far too
still, indeed, as it turned out!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></p>
<p>'I said I couldn't stand a hitch at the hin'eren', young
sir&mdash;any trouble at the tail o' the chapter.'</p>
<p>I looked up&mdash;I <i>had</i> to look up, for the speaker was a
head and shoulders bigger than I&mdash;a broad-shouldered,
brawny, brown-bearded Scotchman. A Highlander evidently
by his brogue, but one who had travelled south,
and therefore only put a Scotch word in here and there
when talking&mdash;just, he told me afterwards, to make better
sense of the English language.</p>
<p>'Do I understand you to mean that something has
happened to delay the voyage?'</p>
<p>'I dinna care whether you understand me or not,' he
replied, with almost fierce independence, 'but we're broken
down.'</p>
<p>It was only too true, and the news soon went all over
the ship&mdash;spread like wild-fire, in fact. Something had
gone wrong in the engine-room, and it would take a
whole week to make good repairs.</p>
<p>I went below to report matters to aunt and my brothers,
and make preparations for disembarking again.</p>
<p>When we reached the deck we found the big Scot
walking up and down with rapid, sturdy strides; but he
stopped in front of me, smiling. He had an immense
plaid thrown Highland-fashion across his chest and left
shoulder, and clutched a huge piece of timber in his hand,
which by courtesy might have been called a cane.</p>
<p>'You'll doubtless go on shore for a spell?' he said.
'A vera judicious arrangement. I'll go myself, and take
my mither with me. And are these your two brotheries,
and your sister? How d'ye do, miss?'</p>
<p>He lifted his huge tam-o'-shanter as he made these
remarks&mdash;or, in other words, he seized it by the top and
raised it into the form of a huge pyramid.</p>
<p>'My aunt,' I said, smiling.</p>
<p>'A thousand pa<i>rr</i>dons, ma'am!' he pleaded, once more
making a pyramid of his 'bonnet,' while the colour
mounted to his brow. 'A thousand pa<i>rr</i>dons!'</p>
<p>Like most of his countrymen, he spoke broader when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
taken off his guard or when excited. At such times the
<i>r</i>'s were thundered or rolled out.</p>
<p>Aunt Cecilia smiled most graciously, and I feel sure she
did not object to be mistaken for our sister.</p>
<p>'It seems,' he added, 'we are to be fellow-passengers.
My name is Moncrieff, and if ever I can be of the
slightest service to you, pray command me.'</p>
<p>'You mentioned your mother,' said aunt, by way of
saying something. 'Is the old&mdash;I mean, is she going with
you?'</p>
<p>'What else, what else? And you wouldn't be wrong in
calling her "old" either. My mither's no' a spring
chicken, but&mdash;she's a marvel. Ay, mither's a marvel.'</p>
<p>'I presume, sir, you've been out before?'</p>
<p>'I've lived for many years in the Silver West. I've
made a bit of money, but I couldn't live a year longer
without my mither, so I just came straight home to take
her out. I think when you know my mither you'll agree
with me&mdash;she's a marvel.'</p>
<p>On pausing here for a minute to review a few of the
events of my past life, I cannot agree with those
pessimists who tell us we are the victims of chance; that
our fates and our fortunes have nothing more certain to
guide them to a good or a bad end than yonder thistle-down
which is the sport of the summer breeze.</p>
<p>When I went on board the good ship Canton, had
any one told me that in a few days more I would be
standing by the banks of Loch Coila, I would have laughed
in his face.</p>
<p>Yet so it was. Aunt and Donald stayed in London,
while I and Dugald formed the strange resolve of running
down and having one farewell glance at Coila. I seemed
impelled to do so, but how or by what I never could say.</p>
<p>No; we did not go near Edinburgh. Good-byes had
been said, why should we rehearse again all the agony of
parting?</p>
<p>Nor did we show ourselves to many of the villagers, and
those who did see us hardly knew us in our English dress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>Just one look at the lake, one glance at the old castle,
and we should be gone, never more to set foot in Coila.</p>
<p>And here we were close by the water, almost under
shadow of our own old home. It was a forenoon in the
end of February, but already the larch-trees were
becoming tinged with tender green, a balmy air went
whispering through the drooping silver birches, the sky
was blue, flecked only here and there with fleecy clouds
that cast shadow-patches on the lake. Up yonder a lark
was singing, in adjoining spruce thickets we could hear the
croodle of the ringdove, and in the swaying branches of the
elms the solemn-looking rooks were already building their
nests. Dugald and I were lying on the moss.</p>
<p>'Spring always comes early to dear Coila,' I was saying;
'and I'm so glad the ship broke down, just to give me a
chance of saying "Good-bye" to the loch. You, Dugald, did
say "Good-bye" to it, you know, but I never had a chance.</p>
<p>Ahem! We were startled by the sound of a little
cough right behind us&mdash;a sort of made cough, such as
people do when they want to attract attention.</p>
<p>Standing near us was a gentleman of soldierly bearing,
but certainly not haughty in appearance, for he was
smiling. He held a book in his hand, and on his arm
leant a beautiful young girl, evidently his daughter, for
both had blue eyes and fair hair.</p>
<p>Dugald and I had started to our feet, and for the life of
me I could not help feeling awkward.</p>
<p>'I fear,' I stammered, 'we are trespassing. But&mdash;but
my brother and I ran down from London to say good-bye
to Coila. We will go at once.'</p>
<p>'Stay one moment,' said the gentleman. 'Do not run
away without explaining. You have been here before?'</p>
<p>'We are the young M'Crimmans of Coila, sir.'</p>
<p>I spoke sadly&mdash;I trust not fiercely.</p>
<p>'Pardon me, but something seemed to tell me you
were. We are pleased to meet you. Irene, my daughter.
It is no fault of ours&mdash;at least, of mine&mdash;that your family
and the M'Raes were not friendly long ago.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>'But my father <i>would</i> have made friends with the chief
of Strathtoul,' I said.</p>
<p>'Yes, and mine had old Highland prejudices. But look,
yonder comes a thunder-shower. You <i>must</i> stay till it is
over.'</p>
<p>'I feel, sir,' I said, 'that I am doing wrong, and that I
have done wrong. My father, even, does not know we
are here. <i>He</i> has prejudices now, too,'</p>
<p>'Well,' said the officer, laughing, 'my father is in
France. Let us both be naughty boys. You must come
and dine with me and my daughter, anyhow. Bother old-fashioned
blood-feuds! We must not forget that we are
living in the nineteenth century.'</p>
<p>I hesitated a moment, then I glanced at the girl, and
next minute we were all walking together towards the
castle.</p>
<p>We did stop to dinner, nor did we think twice about
leaving that night. The more I saw of these, our hereditary
enemies, the more I liked them. Irene was very
like Flora in appearance and manner, but she had a
greater knowledge of the world and all its ways. She was
very beautiful. Yes, I have said so already, but somehow
I cannot help saying it again. She looked older than she
really was, and taller than most girls of fourteen.</p>
<p>'Well,' I said in course of the evening, 'it <i>is</i> strange my
being here.'</p>
<p>'It is only the fortune of war our both being here,' said
M'Rae.</p>
<p>'I wonder,' I added, 'how it will all end!'</p>
<p>'If it would only end as I should wish, it would end
very pleasantly indeed. But it will not. You will write
filially and tell your good father of your visit. He will
write cordially, but somewhat haughtily, to thank us.
That will be all. Oh, Highland blood is very red, and
Highland pride is very high. Well, at all events, Murdoch
M'Crimman&mdash;if you will let me call you by your name
without the "Mr."&mdash;we shall never forget your visit,
shall we, darling?'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>I looked towards Miss M'Rae. Her answer was a
simple 'No'; but I was much surprised to notice that her
eyes were full of tears, which she tried in vain to conceal.</p>
<p>I saw tears in her eyes next morning as we parted.
Her father said 'Good-bye' so kindly that my whole heart
went out to him on the spot.</p>
<p>'I'm not sorry I came,' I said; 'and, sir,' I added, 'as
far as you and I are concerned, the feud is at an end?'</p>
<p>'Yes, yes; and better so. And,' he continued, 'my
daughter bids me say that she is happy to have seen you,
that she is going to think about you very often, and is so
sorrowful you poor lads should have to go away to a
foreign land to seek your fortune while we remain at Coila.
That is the drift of it, but I fear I have not said it prettily
enough to please Irene. Good-bye.'</p>
<p>We had found fine weather at Coila, and we brought it
back with us to London. There was no hitch this time in
starting. The Canton got away early in the morning, even
before breakfast. The last person to come on board was
the Scot, Moncrieff. He came thundering across the plank
gangway with strides like a camel, bearing something or
somebody rolled in a tartan plaid.</p>
<p>Dugald and I soon noticed two little legs dangling from
one end of the bundle and a little old face peeping out of
the other. It was his mother undoubtedly.</p>
<p>He put her gently down when he gained the deck, and
led her away amidships somewhere, and there the two
disappeared. Presently Moncrieff came back alone and
shook hands with us in the most friendly way.</p>
<p>'I've just disposed of my mither,' he said, as if she had
been a piece of goods and he had sold her. 'I've just
disposed of the poor dear creature, and maybe she won't
appear again till we're across the bay.'</p>
<p>'You did not take the lady below?'</p>
<p>'There's no' much of the lady about my mither, though
I'm doing all I can to make her one. No; I didn't take
her below. Fact is, we have state apartments, as you
might say, for I've rented the second lieutenant's and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
purser's cabins. There they are, cheek-by-jowl, as cosy as
wrens'-nests, just abaft the cook's galley amidships
yonder.'</p>
<p>'Well,' I said, 'I hope your mother will be happy and
enjoy the voyage.'</p>
<p>'Hurrah!' shouted the Scot; 'we're off at last! Now
for a fair wind and a clear sea to the shores of the Silver
West. I'll run and tell my mither we're off.'</p>
<p>That evening the sun sank on the western waves with a
crimson glory that spoke of fine weather to follow. We
were steaming down channel with just enough sail set to
give us some degree of steadiness.</p>
<p>Though my brothers and I had never been to sea before,
we had been used to roughing it in storms around the
coast and on Loch Coila, and probably this may account
for our immunity from that terror of the ocean, <i>mal-de-mer</i>.
As for aunt, she was an excellent sailor. The saloon, when
we went below to dinner, was most gay, beautifully lighted,
and very home-like. The officers present were the captain,
the surgeon, and one lieutenant. The captain was
president, while the doctor occupied the chair of <i>vice</i>.
Both looked thorough sailors, and both appeared as happy
as kings. There seemed also to exist a perfect understanding
between the pair, and their remarks and
anecdotes kept the passengers in excellent good humour
during dinner.</p>
<p>The doctor had been the first to enter, and he came
sailing in with aunt, whom he seated on his right hand.
Now aunt was the only young lady among the passengers,
and she certainly had dressed most becomingly. I could
not help admiring her&mdash;so did the doctor, but so also did
the captain.</p>
<p>When he entered he gave his surgeon a comical kind of
a look and shook his head.</p>
<p>'Walked to windward of me, I see!' he said. 'Miss
M'Crimman,' he added, 'we don't, as a rule, keep particular
seats at table in this ship.'</p>
<p>'Don't believe a word he says, Miss M'Crimman!' cried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
the doctor. 'Look, he's laughing! He never is serious
when he smiles like that. Steward, what is the number
of this chair?'</p>
<p>'Fifteen, sir.'</p>
<p>'Fifteen, Miss M'Crimman, and you won't forget it; and
this table-napkin ring, observe, is Gordon tartan, green and
black and orange.'</p>
<p>'Miss M'Crimman,' the captain put in, as if the doctor
had not said a word, 'to-morrow evening, for example, you
will have the honour to sit on my right.'</p>
<p>'Honour, indeed!' laughed the doctor.</p>
<p>'The honour to sit on my right. You will find I can
tell much better stories than old Conserve-of-roses there;
and I feel certain you will not sit anywhere else all the
voyage!'</p>
<p>'Ah, stay one moments!' cried a merry-looking little
Spaniard, who had just entered and seated himself quietly
at the table; 'the young lady weel not always sit dere, or
dere, for sometime she weel have de honour to sit at my
right hand, for example, eh, capitan?'</p>
<p>There was a hearty laugh at these words, and after this,
every one seemed on the most friendly terms with every one
else, and willing to serve every one else first and himself
last. This is one good result that accrues from travelling,
and I have hardly ever yet known a citizen of the world
who could be called selfish.</p>
<p>There were three other ladies at table to-night, each of
whom sat by her husband's side. Though they were all in
what Dr. Spinks afterwards termed the sere and yellow
leaf, both he and the good captain really vied with each
other in paying kindly attention to their wants.</p>
<p>So pleasantly did this our first dinner on board pass
over that by the time we had risen from our seats we felt,
one and all, as if we had known each other for a very long
time indeed.</p>
<p>Next came our evening concert. One of the married
ladies played exceedingly well, and the little Spanish
gentleman sang like a minor Sims Reeves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>'Your sister sings, I feel sure,' he said to me.</p>
<p>'My aunt plays the harp and sings,' I answered.</p>
<p>'And the harp&mdash;you have him?'</p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p>'Oh, bring him&mdash;bring him! I do love de harp!'</p>
<p>While my aunt played and sang, it would have been
difficult to say which of her audience listened with the
most delighted attention. The doctor's face was a study;
the captain looked tenderly serious; Captain Bombazo, the
black-moustachioed Spaniard, was animation personified;
his dark eyes sparkled like diamonds, his very eyelids
appeared to snap with pleasure. Even the stewards and
stewardess lingered in the passage to listen with respectful
attention, so that it is no wonder we boys were
proud of our clever aunt.</p>
<p>When she ceased at last there was that deep silence
which is far more eloquent than applause. The first to
break it was Moncrieff.</p>
<p>'Well,' he said, with a deep sigh, 'I never heard the
like o' that afore!'</p>
<p>The friendly relations thus established in the saloon
lasted all the voyage long&mdash;so did the captain's, the
doctor's, and little Spanish officer's attentions to my aunt.
She had made a triple conquest; three hearts, to speak
figuratively, lay at her feet.</p>
<p>Our voyage was by no means a very eventful one, and
but little different from thousands of others that take
place every month.</p>
<p>Some degree of merriment was caused among the men,
when, on the fourth day, big Moncrieff led his mother out
to walk the quarter-deck leaning on his arm. She was
indeed a marvel. It would have been impossible even to
guess at her age; for though her face was as yellow as a
withered lemon, and as wrinkled as a Malaga rasin, she
walked erect and firm, and was altogether as straight as a
rush. She was dressed with an eye to comfort, for, warm
though the weather was getting, her cloak was trimmed
with fur. On her head she wore a neat old-fashioned cap,
and in her hand carried a huge green umbrella, which
evening and morning she never laid down except at
meals.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></div>
<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>This umbrella was a weapon of offence as well as
defence. We had proof of that on the very first day, for
as he passed along the deck the second steward had the
bad manners to titter. Next moment the umbrella had
descended with crushing force on his head, and he lay
sprawling in the lee scuppers.</p>
<p>'I'll teach ye,' she said, 'to laugh at an auld wife, you
gang-the-gate swinger.'</p>
<p>'Mither! mither!' pleaded Moncrieff, 'will you never
be able to behave like a lady?'</p>
<p>The steward crawled forward crestfallen, and the men
did not let him forget his adventure in a hurry.</p>
<p>'Mither's a ma<i>rr</i>vel,' Moncrieff whispered to me more
than once that evening, for at table no 'laird's lady' could
have behaved so well, albeit her droll remarks and
repartee kept us all laughing. After dinner it was just
the same&mdash;there were no bounds to her good-nature, her
excellent spirits and comicality. Even when asked to
sing she was by no means taken aback, but treated us to a
ballad of five-and-twenty verses, with a chorus to each;
but as it told a story of love and war, of battle and siege,
of villainy for a time in the ascendant, and virtue
triumphant at the end, it really was not a bit wearisome;
and when Moncrieff told us that she could sing a hundred
more as good, we all agreed that his mother was indeed a
marvel.</p>
<p>I have said the voyage was uneventful, but this is
talking as one who has been across the wide ocean many
times and oft. No long voyage can be uneventful; but
nothing very dreadful happened to mar our passage to Rio
de Janeiro. We were not caught in a tornado; we were
not chased by a pirate; we saw no suspicious sail; no
ghostly voice hailed us from aloft at the midnight hour;
no shadowy form beckoned us from a fog. We did not
even spring a leak, nor did the mainyard come tumbling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
down. But we <i>did</i> have foul weather off Finisterre; a
man <i>did</i> fall overboard, and was duly picked up again; a
shark <i>did</i> follow the ship for a week, but got no corpse to
devour, only the contents of the cook's pail, sundry bullets
from sundry revolvers, and, finally, a red-hot brick rolled
in a bit of blanket. Well, of course, a man fell from aloft
and knocked his shoulder out&mdash;a man always does&mdash;and
Mother Carey's chickens flew around our stern, boding
bad weather, which never came, and shoals of porpoises
danced around us at sunset, and we saw huge whales
pursuing their solitary path through the bosom of the
great deep, and we breakfasted off flying fish, and caught
Cape pigeons, and wondered at the majestic flight of the
albatross; and we often saw lightning without hearing
thunder, and heard thunder without seeing lightning; and
in due course we heard the thrilling shout from aloft of
'Land ho!' and heard the officer of the watch sing out,
'Where away?'</p>
<p>And lo and behold! three or four hours afterwards we
were all on deck marvelling at the rugged grandeur of the
shores of Rio, and the wondrous steeple-shaped mountain
that stands sentry for ever and ever and ever at the
entrance to the marvellous haven.</p>
<p>When this was in sight, Moncrieff rushed off into the
cabin and bore his mother out.</p>
<p>He held the old lady aloft, on one arm, shouting, as he
pointed landwards&mdash;</p>
<p>'Look, mither, look! the Promised Land! Our new
home in the Silver West!'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>ON SHORE AT RIO.</h3>
</div>

<p>It was well on in the afternoon when land was sighted,
but so accurately had the ship been navigated for all
the long, pleasant weeks of our voyage that both the
captain and his first officer might easily have been excused
for showing a little pride in their seamanship. Your British
sailor, however, is always a modest man, and there was not
the slightest approach to bombast. The ship was now
slowed, for we could not cross the bar that night.</p>
<p>At the dinner-table we were all as merry as schoolboys
on the eve of a holiday. Old Jenny, as Moncrieff's mother
had come to be called, was in excellent spirits, and her
droll remarks not only made us laugh, but rendered it very
difficult indeed for the stewards to wait with anything
approaching to <i>sang-froid</i>. Moncrieff was quietly happy.
He seemed pleased his mother was so great a favourite.
Aunt, in her tropical toilet, looked angelic. The adjective
was applied by our mutual friend Captain Roderigo de
Bombazo, and my brothers and I agreed that he had
spoken the truth for once in a way. Did he not always
speak the truth? it may be asked. I am not prepared to
accuse the worthy Spaniard of deliberate falsehood, but if
everything he told us was true, then he must indeed have
come through more wild and terrible adventures, and done
more travelling and more fighting, than any lion-hunter
that ever lived and breathed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>He was highly amusing nevertheless, and as no one, with
the exception of Jenny, ever gave any evidence of doubting
what he said and related concerning his strange career, he
was encouraged to carry on; and even the exploits of Baron
Munchausen could not have been compared to some of his.
I think it used to hurt his feelings somewhat that old
Jenny listened so stolidly to his relations, for he used to
cater for her opinion at times.</p>
<p>'Ah!' Jenny would say, 'you're a wonderful mannie wi'
your way o't! And what a lot you've come through! I
wonder you have a hair in your heed!'</p>
<p>'But the señora believes vot I say?'</p>
<p>'Believe ye? If a' stories be true, yours are no lees,
and I'm not goin' ahint your back to tell ye, sir.'</p>
<p>Once, on deck, he was drawing the long-bow, as the
Yankees call it, at a prodigious rate. He was telling how,
once upon a time, he had caught a young alligator; how
he had tamed it and fed it till it grew a monster twenty
feet long; how he used to saddle it and bridle it, and ride
through the streets of Tulcora on its back&mdash;men, women,
and children screaming and flying in all directions; how,
armed only with his good sabre, he rode it into a lake
which was infested with these dread saurians; how he was
attacked in force by the awful reptiles, and how he had
killed and wounded so many that they lay dead in dozens
next day along the banks.</p>
<p>'Humph!' grunted old Jenny when he had finished.</p>
<p>The little captain put the questions,</p>
<p>'Ah! de aged señora not believe! De aged señora not
have seen much of de world?'</p>
<p>Jenny had grasped her umbrella.</p>
<p>'Look here, my mannie,' she said, 'I'll gie ye a caution;
dinna you refer to my age again, or I'll "aged-snorer" you.
If ye get the weight o' my gingham on your shou'ders, ye'll
think a coo has kick't ye&mdash;so mind.'</p>
<p>And the Spanish captain had slunk away very unlike a
lion-hunter, but he never called Jenny old again.</p>
<p>To-night, however, even before we had gone below,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
Jenny had given proofs that she was in an extra good
temper, for being a little way behind Bombazo&mdash;as if
impelled by some sudden and joyous impulse&mdash;she lifted
that everlasting umbrella and hit him a friendly thwack
that could be heard from bowsprit to binnacle.</p>
<p>'Tell as mony lees the nicht as ye like, my mannie,' she
cried, 'and I'll never contradict ye, for I've seen the
promised land!'</p>
<p>'And so, captain, you must stay at Rio a whole week?'
said my aunt at dessert.</p>
<p>'Yes, Miss M'Crimman,' replied the captain. 'Are you
pleased?'</p>
<p>'I'm delighted. And I propose that we get up a grand
picnic in "the promised land," as good old Jenny calls it.'</p>
<p>And so it was arranged. Bombazo and Dr. Spinks,
having been at Rio de Janeiro before, were entrusted with
the organization of the 'pig-neeg,' as Bombazo called it,
and held their first consultation on ways and means that
very evening. Neither I nor my brothers were admitted
to this meeting, though aunt was. Nevertheless, we felt
confident the picnic would be a grand success, for, to a late
hour, men were hurrying fore and aft, and the stewards
were up to their eyes packing baskets and making preparations,
while from the cook's gally gleams of rosy light
shot out every time the door was opened, to say nothing of
odours so appetising that they would have awakened Van
Winkle himself.</p>
<p>Before we turned in, we went on deck to have a look at
the night. It was certainly full of promise. We were not
far from the shore&mdash;near enough to see a long line of
white which we knew was breakers, and to hear their deep
sullen boom as they spent their fury on the rocks. The
sky was studded with brilliant stars&mdash;far more bright, we
thought them, than any we ever see in our own cold
climate. Looking aloft, the tall masts seemed to mix and
mingle with the stars at every roll of the ship. The moon,
too, was as bright as silver in the east, its beams making
strange quivering lines and crescents in each approaching
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
wave. And somewhere&mdash;yonder among those wondrous
cone-shaped hills, now bathed in this purple moonlight&mdash;lay
the promised land, the romantic town of Rio, which
to-morrow we should visit.</p>
<p>We went below, and, as if by one accord, my brothers
and I knelt down together to thank the Great Power on
high who had guided us safely over the wide illimitable
ocean, and to implore His blessing on those at home, and
His guidance on all our future wanderings.</p>
<p>Early next morning we were awakened by a great noise
on deck, and the dash and turmoil of breaking water.
The rudder-chains, too, were constantly rattling as the men
at the wheel obeyed the shouts of the officer of the watch.</p>
<p>'Starboard a little!'</p>
<p>'Starboard it is, sir!'</p>
<p>'Easy as you go! Steady!'</p>
<p>'Steady it is, sir!'</p>
<p>'Port a little! Steady!'</p>
<p>Then came a crash that almost flung us out of our beds.
Before we gained the deck of our cabin there was another,
and still another. Had we run on shore? We dreaded to
ask each other.</p>
<p>But just then the steward, with kindly thought, drew
back our curtain and reassured us.</p>
<p>'We're only bumping over the bar, young gentlemen&mdash;we'll
be in smooth water in a jiffey.'</p>
<p>We were soon all dressed and on deck. We were
passing the giant hill called Sugar Loaf, and the mountains
seemed to grow taller and taller, and to frown over
us as we got nearer.</p>
<p>Once through the entrance, the splendid bay itself lay
spread out before us in all its silver beauty. Full twenty
miles across it is, and everywhere surrounded by the
grandest hills imaginable. Not even in our dreams could
we have conceived of such a noble harbour, for here not
only could all the fleets in the world lie snug, but even
cruise and man&oelig;uvre. Away to the west lay the picturesque
town itself, its houses and public buildings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
shining clear in the morning sun, those nearest nestling in a
beauty of tropical foliage I have never seen surpassed.</p>
<p>My brothers and I felt burning to land at once, but
regulations must be carried out, and before we had cleared
the customs, and got a clean bill of health, the day was
far spent. Our picnic must be deferred till to-morrow.</p>
<p>However, we could land.</p>
<p>As they took their seats in the boat and she was rowed
shoreward, I noticed that Donald and Dugald seemed both
speechless with delight and admiration; as for me, I felt
as if suddenly transported to a new world. And such a
world&mdash;beauty and loveliness everywhere around us!
How should I ever be able to describe it, I kept wondering&mdash;how
give dear old mother and Flora any notion,
even the most remote, of the delight instilled into our
souls by all we saw and felt in this strange, strange land!
Without doubt, the beauty of our surroundings constitutes
one great factor in our happiness, wherever we are.</p>
<p>When we landed&mdash;indeed, before we landed&mdash;while the
boat was still skimming over the purple waters, the green
mountains appearing to mingle and change places every
moment as we were borne along, I felt conquered, if I
may so express it, by the enchantment of my situation. I
gave in my allegiance to the spirit of the scene, I
abandoned all thoughts of being able to describe anything,
I abandoned myself to enjoyment. <i>Laisser faire</i>, I
said to my soul, is to live. Every creature, every being
here seems happy. To partake of the <i>dolce far niente</i>
appears the whole aim and object of their lives.</p>
<p>And so I stepped on shore, regretting somewhat that
Flora was not here, feeling how utterly impossible it
would be to write that 'good letter' home descriptive of
this wondrous medley of tropical life and loveliness, but
somewhat reckless withal, and filled with a determination
to give full rein to my sense of pleasure. I could not help
wondering, however, if everything I saw was real. Was I
in a dream, from which I should presently be rudely
awakened by the rattle and clatter of the men hauling up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
ashes, and find myself in bed on board the Canton?
Never mind, I would enjoy it were it even a dream.</p>
<p>What a motley crowd of people of every colour! How
jolly those negroes look! How gaily the black ladies are
dressed! How the black men laugh! What piles of
fruit and green stuff! What a rich, delicious, warm
aroma hovers everywhere!</p>
<p>An interpreter? You needn't ask <i>me</i>. I'm not in
charge. Ask my aunt here; but she herself can talk
many languages. Or ask that tall brawny Scot, who is
hustling the darkies about as if South America all
belonged to him.</p>
<p>'A carriage, Moncrieff? Oh, this is delightful! Auntie,
dear, let me help you on board. Hop in, Dugald. Jump,
Donald. No, no, Moncrieff, I mean to have the privilege
of sitting beside the driver. Off we go. Hurrah! Do
you like it, Donald? But aren't the streets rough! I
won't talk any more; I want to watch things.'</p>
<p>I wonder, though, if Paradise itself was a bit more lovely
than the gardens we catch glimpses of as we drive along?</p>
<p>How cool they look, though the sun is shining in a blue
and cloudless sky! What dark shadows those gently
waving palm-trees throw! Look at those cottage verandahs!
Look, oh, look at the wealth of gorgeous flowers&mdash;the
climbing, creeping, wreathing flowers! What
colours! What fantastic shapes! What a merry mood
Nature must have been in when she framed them so!
And the perfume from those fairy gardens hangs heavy on
the air; the delicious balmy breeze that blows through
the green, green palm-leaves is not sufficient to waft
away the odour of that orange blossom. Behold those
beautiful children in groups, on terraces and lawns, at
windows, or in verandahs&mdash;so gaily are they dressed that
they themselves might be mistaken for bouquets of lovely
flowers!</p>
<p>I wonder what the names of all those strange blossom-bearing
shrubs are. But, bah! who would bother about
names of flowers on a day like this? The butterflies do
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
not, and the bees do not. Are those really butterflies,
though&mdash;really and truly? Are they not gorgeously painted
fans, waved and wafted by fairies, themselves unseen?</p>
<p>The people we meet chatter gaily as we pass, but they
do not appear to possess a deal of curiosity; they are
too contented for anything. All life here must be one
delicious round of enjoyment. And nobody surely ever
dies here; I do not see how they could.</p>
<p>'Is this a cave we are coming to, Moncrieff? What is
that long row of columns and that high, green, vaulted
roof, through which hardly a ray of sunshine can struggle?
Palm-trees! Oh, Moncrieff, what glorious palms! And
there is life upon life there, for the gorgeous trees, not
apparently satisfied with their own magnificence of shape
and foliage, must array themselves in wreaths of dazzling
orchids and festoons of trailing flowers. The fairies <i>must</i>
have hung those flowers there? Do not deny it,
Moncrieff!'</p>
<p>And here, in the Botanical Gardens, imagination must
itself be dumb&mdash;such a wild wealth of all that is charming
in the vegetable and animal creation.</p>
<p>'Donald, go your own road. Dugald, go yours; let us
wander alone. We may meet again some day. It hardly
matters whether we do or not. I'm in a dream, and I
don't think I want to awaken for many a long year.'</p>
<p>I go wandering away from my brothers, away from
every one.</p>
<p>A fountain is sending its spray aloft till the green
drooping branches of the bananas and those feathery tree-ferns
are everywhere spangled with diamonds. I will rest
here. I wish I could catch a few of those wondrous
butterflies, or even one of those fairylike humming-birds&mdash;mere
sparks of light and colour that flit and buzz from flower
to flower. I wish I could&mdash;that I&mdash;I mean&mdash;I&mdash;wish&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Hullo! Murdoch. Where are you? Why, here he is
at last, sound asleep under an orange-tree!'</p>
<p>It is my wild Highland brothers. They have both been
shaking me by the shoulders. I sit up and rub my eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>'Do you know we've been looking for you for over an
hour?'</p>
<p>'Ah, Dugald!' I reply, 'what is an hour, one wee hour,
in a place like this?'</p>
<p>We must now go to visit the market-place, and then we
are going to the hotel to dine and sleep.</p>
<p>The market is a wondrously mixed one, and as
wondrously foreign and strange as it is possible to conceive.
The gay dresses of the women&mdash;some of whom are as black
as an ebony ball; their gaudy head-gear; their glittering
but tinselled ornaments; their round laughing faces, in
which shine rows of teeth as white perhaps as alabaster;
the jaunty men folks; the world of birds and beasts, all on
the best of terms with themselves, especially the former,
arrayed in all the colours of the rainbow; the world of
fruit, tempting in shape, in beauty, and in odour; the
world of fish, some of them beautiful enough to have
dwelt in the coral caves of fairyland beneath the glittering
sea&mdash;some ugly, even hideous enough to be the creatures
of a demon's dream, and some, again, so odd-looking or so
grotesque as to make one smile or laugh outright;&mdash;the
whole made up a picture that even now I have but to
close my eyes to see again!</p>
<p>When night falls the streets get for a time more
crowded; side-paths hardly exist&mdash;at all events, the
inhabitants show their independence by crowding along the
centre of the streets. Not much light to guide them,
though, except where from open doors or windows the rays
from lamps shoot out into the darkness.</p>
<p>Away to the hotel. A dinner in a delightfully cool,
large room, a punkah waving overhead, brilliant lights, joy
on all our faces, a dessert fit to set before a king. Now
we shall know how those strange fruits taste, whose
perfume hung around the market to-day. To bed at last
in a room scented with orange-blossoms, and around the
windows of which the sweet stephanotis clusters in beauty&mdash;to
bed, to sleep, and dream of all we have done and seen.</p>
<p>We awaken&mdash;at least, I do&mdash;in the morning with a glad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
sensation of anticipated pleasure. What is it? Oh yes,
the picnic!</p>
<p>But it is no ordinary picnic. It lasts for three long
days and nights, during which we drive by day through
scenes of enchantment apparently, and sleep by night
under canvas, wooed to slumber by the wind whispering
in the waving trees.</p>
<p>'Moncrieff,' I say on the second day, 'I should like to
live here for ever and ever and ever.'</p>
<p>'Man!' replies Moncrieff, 'I'm glad ye enjoy it, and so
does my mither here. But dinna forget, lads, that hard
work is all before us when we reach Buenos Ayres.'</p>
<p>'But I will, and I <i>shall</i> forget, Moncrieff,' I cry. 'This
country is full of forgetfulness. Away with all thoughts of
work; let us revel in the sunshine like the bees, and the
birds, and the butterflies.'</p>
<p>'Revel away, then,' says Moncrieff; and dear aunt
smiles languidly.</p>
<p>On the last day of 'the show,' as Dugald called it, and
while our mule team is yet five good miles from town,
clouds dark and threatening bank rapidly up in the west.
The driver lashes the beasts and encourages them with
shout and cry to do their speedy utmost; but the storm
breaks over us in all its fury, the thunder seems to rend
the very mountains, the rain pours down in white sheets,
the lightning runs along the ground and looks as if it
would set the world on fire; the wind goes tearing through
the trees, bending the palms like reeds, rending the broad
banana-leaves to ribbons; branches crack and fall down,
and the whole air is filled with whirling fronds and foliage.</p>
<p>Moncrieff hastily envelopes his mother in that Highland
plaid till nought is visible of the old lady save the nose
and one twinkling eye. We laugh in spite of the storm.
Louder and louder roars the thunder, faster and faster fly
the mules, and at last we are tearing along the deserted
streets, and hastily draw up our steaming steeds at the
hotel door. And that is almost all I remember of Rio;
and to-morrow we are off to sea once more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>MONCRIEFF RELATES HIS EXPERIENCES.</h3>
</div>

<p>Our life at sea had been like one long happy dream.
That, at all events, is how it had felt to me. 'A
dream I could have wished to last for aye.' I was
enamoured of the ocean, and more than once I caught
myself yearning to be a sailor. There are people who are
born with strange longings, strange desires, which only a
life on the ever-changing, ever-restless waves appears to
suit and soothe. To such natures the sea seems like a
mother&mdash;a wild, hard, harsh mother at times, perhaps, but
a mother who, if she smiles but an hour, makes them
forget her stormy anger of days or weeks.</p>
<p>But the dream was past and gone. And here we had
settled down for a spell at Buenos Ayres. We had parted
with the kindly captain and surgeon of the Canton, with
many a heartily expressed hope of meeting again another
day, with prayers on their side for our success in the new
land, with kindliest wishes on ours for a pleasant voyage
and every joy for them.</p>
<p>Dear me! What a very long time it felt to look back
to, since we had bidden them 'good-bye' at home! How
very old I was beginning to feel! I asked my brothers if
their feelings were the same, and found them identical.
Time had been apparently playing tricks on us.</p>
<p>And yet we did not look any older in each other's eyes,
only just a little more serious. Yes, that was it&mdash;<i>serious</i>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
Even Dugald, who was usually the most light-hearted and
merry of the three of us, looked as if he fully appreciated
the magnitude of what we had undertaken.</p>
<p>Here we were, three&mdash;well, young men say, though some
would have called us boys&mdash;landed on a foreign shore,
without an iota of experience, without much knowledge of
the country apart from that we had gleaned from books or
gathered from the conversations of Bombazo and Moncrieff.
And yet we had landed with the intention, nay, even the
determination, to make our way in the new land&mdash;not
only to seek our fortunes, but to find them.</p>
<p>Oh, we were not afraid! We had the glorious inheritance
of courage, perseverance, and self-reliance. Here is
how Donald, my brother, argued one night:</p>
<p>'Look, here, Murdo,' he said. 'This <i>is</i> a land of milk
and honey, isn't it? Well, we're going to be the busy bees
to gather it. It <i>is</i> a silver land, isn't it? Well, we're
the boys to tap it. Fortunes <i>are</i> made here, and <i>have</i> been
made. What is done once can be done five hundred
times. Whatever men dare they can do. <i>Quod erat
demonstrandum.</i>'</p>
<p>'<i>Et nil desperandum</i>,' added Dugald.</p>
<p>'I'm not joking, I can tell you, Dugald, I'm serious now,
and I mean to remain so, and stick to work&mdash;aren't you,
Murdo?'</p>
<p>'I am, Donald.'</p>
<p>Then we three brothers, standing there, one might say,
on the confines of an unknown country, with all the world
before us, shook hands, and our looks, as we gazed into
each other's eyes, said&mdash;if they said anything&mdash;'We'll do
the right thing one by the other, come weal, come woe.'</p>
<p>Aunt entered soon after.</p>
<p>'What are you boys so serious about?' she said, laughing
merrily, as she seated herself on the couch. 'You look
like three conspirators.'</p>
<p>'So we are, aunt. We're conspiring together to make
our fortunes.'</p>
<p>'What! building castles in the air?'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>'Oh, no, no, <i>no</i>,' cried Donald, 'not in the air, but on the
earth. And our idols are not going to have feet of clay, I
assure you, auntie, but of solid silver.'</p>
<p>'Well, we shall hope for the best. I have just parted
with Mr. Moncrieff, whom I met down town. We have
had a long walk together and quite a nice chat. He has
made me his confidant&mdash;think of that!'</p>
<p>'What! you, auntie?'</p>
<p>'Yes, me. Who else? And that sober, honest, decent,
Scot is going to take a wife. It was so good of him to
tell <i>me</i>. We are all going to the wedding next week,
and I'm sure I wish the dear man every happiness and
joy.'</p>
<p>'So do we, aunt.'</p>
<p>'And oh, by the way, he is coming to dine here to-night,
and I feel sure he wants to give you good advice, and that
means me too, of course.'</p>
<p>'Of course, auntie, you're one of us.'</p>
<p>Moncrieff arrived in good time, and brought his mother
with him.</p>
<p>'Ye didn't include my mither in the invitation, Miss
M'Crimman,' said the Scot; 'but I knew you meant her to
come. I've been so long without the poor old creature,
that I hardly care to move about without her now.'</p>
<p>'Poor old creature, indeed!' Mrs. Moncrieff was heard
to mumble. 'Where,' she said to a nattily dressed waiter,
'will you put my umbrella?'</p>
<p>'I'll take the greatest care of it, madam,' the man replied.</p>
<p>'Do, then,' said the little old dame, 'and I may gi'e ye a
penny, though I dinna mak' ony promises, mind.'</p>
<p>A nicer little dinner was never served, nor could a
snugger room for such a <i>tête-à-tête</i> meal be easily
imagined. It was on the ground floor, the great casement
windows opening on to a verandah in a shady garden,
where grass was kept green and smooth as velvet, where
rare ferns grew in luxurious freedom with dwarf palms
and drooping bananas, and where stephanotis and the
charming lilac bougainvillea were still in bloom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>When the dessert was finished, and old Jenny was quite
tired talking, it seemed so natural that she should curl up
in an easy-chair and go off to sleep.</p>
<p>'I hope my umbrella's safe, laddie,' were her last words
as her son wrapped her in his plaid.</p>
<p>'As safe as the Union Bank,' he replied.</p>
<p>So we left her there, for the waiter had taken coffee into
the verandah.</p>
<p>Aunt, somewhat to our astonishment, ordered cigars, and
explained to Moncrieff that she did not object to smoking,
but <i>did</i> like to see men happy.</p>
<p>Moncrieff smiled.</p>
<p>'You're a marvel as well as my mither,' he said.</p>
<p>He smoked on in silence for fully five minutes, but he
often took the cigar from his mouth and looked at it
thoughtfully; then he would allow his eyes to follow the
curling smoke, watching it with a smile on his face as it
faded into invisibility, as they say ghosts do.</p>
<p>'Mr. Moncrieff,' said aunt, archly, 'I know what you are
thinking about.'</p>
<p>Moncrieff waved his hand through a wreath of smoke as
if to clear his sight.</p>
<p>'If you were a man,' he answered, 'I'd offer to bet you
couldn't guess my thoughts. I was not thinking about my
Dulcinea, nor even about my mither; I was thinking
about you and your britheries&mdash;I mean your nephews.'</p>
<p>'You are very kind, Mr. Moncrieff.'</p>
<p>'I'm a man of the wo<i>rrr</i>ld, though I wasn't aye a man of
the wo<i>rrr</i>ld. I had to pay deep and dear for my
experience, Miss M'Crimman.'</p>
<p>'I can easily believe that; but you have benefited by it.'</p>
<p>'Doubtless, doubtless; only it was concerning yourselves
I was about to make an observation or two.'</p>
<p>'Oh, thanks, do. You are so kind.'</p>
<p>'Never a bit. This is a weary wo<i>rrr</i>ld at best. Where
would any of us land if the one didn't help the other?
Well then, there you sit, and woman of the wo<i>rrr</i>ld
though you be, you're in a strange corner of it. You're in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
a foreign land now if ever you were. You have few
friends. Bah! what are all your letters of introduction
worth? What do they bring you in? A few invitations
to dinner, or to spend a week up country by a wealthy
<i>estanciero</i>, advice from this friend and the next friend, and
from a dozen friends maybe, but all different. You are
already getting puzzled. You don't know what to do for
the best. You're stopping here to look about you, as the
saying is. You might well ask me what right have I to
advise you. The right of brotherhood, I may answer. By
birth and station you may be far above me, but&mdash;you are
friends&mdash;you are from dear auld Scotland. Boys, you are
my brothers!'</p>
<p>'And I your sister!' Aunt extended her hand as she
spoke, and the worthy fellow 'coralled' it, so to speak, in
his big brown fist, and tears sprang to his eyes.</p>
<p>He pulled himself up sharp, however, and surrounded
himself with smoke, as the cuttle-fish does with black
water, and probably for the same reason&mdash;to escape
observation.</p>
<p>'Now,' he said, 'this is no time for sentiment; it is no
land for sentiment, but for hard work. Well, what are
you going to do? Simply to say you're going to make
your fortune is all fiddlesticks and folly. How are you
going to begin?'</p>
<p>'We were thinking&mdash;' I began, but paused.</p>
<p>'<i>I</i> was thinking&mdash;' said my aunt; then she paused
also.</p>
<p>Moncrieff laughed, but not unmannerly.</p>
<p>'I was thinking,' he said. '<i>You</i> were thinking; <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>,
or <i>it</i> was thinking. Well, my good people, you may stop
all your life in Buenos Ayres and conjugate the verb "to
think"; but if you'll take my advice you will put a
shoulder to the wheel of life, and try to conjugate the
verb "to do".'</p>
<p>'We all want to <i>do</i> and act,' said Donald, energetically.</p>
<p>'Right. Well, you see, you have one thing already in
your favour. You have a wee bit o' siller in your pouch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
It is a nest egg, though; it is not to be spent&mdash;it is there
to bring more beside it. Now, will I tell you how I got
on in the world? I'm not rich, but I am in a fair way to
be independent. I am very fond of work, for work's sake,
and I'm thirty years of age. Been in this country now for
over fourteen years. Had I had a nest egg when I started,
I'd have been half a millionaire by now. But, wae's me!
I left the old country with nothing belonging to me but my
crook and my plaid.'</p>
<p>'You were a shepherd before you came out, then?' said aunt.</p>
<p>'Yes; and that was the beauty of it. You've maybe
heard o' Foudland, in Aberdeenshire? Well, I came fra
far ayant the braes o' Foudland. That's, maybe, the way
my mither's sae auldfarrent. There, ye see, I'm talkin'
Scotch, for the very thought of Foudland brings back my
Scotch tongue. Ay, dear lady, dear lady, my father was
an honest crofter there. He owned a bit farm and
everything, and things went pretty well with us till
death tirled at the door-sneck and took poor father away
to the mools. I was only a callan o' some thirteen
summers then, and when we had to leave the wee croft
and sell the cows we were fain to live in a lonely shieling
on the bare brae side, just a butt and a ben with a wee
kailyard, and barely enough land to grow potatoes and
keep a little Shetland cowie. But, young though I was,
I could herd sheep&mdash;under a shepherd at first, but finally
all by myself. I'm not saying that wasn't a happy time.
Oh, it was, lady! it was! And many a night since then
have I lain awake thinking about it, till every scene of my
boyhood's days rose up before me. I could see the hills,
green with the tints of spring, or crimson with the glorious
heather of autumn; see the braes yellow-tasselled with the
golden broom and fragrant with the blooming whins; see
the glens and dells, the silver, drooping birch-trees, the
grand old waving pines, the wimpling burns, the roaring
linns and lochs asleep in the evening sunset. And see my
mither's shieling, too; and many a night have I lain awake
to pray I might have her near me once again.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>'And a kind God has answered that prayer!'</p>
<p>'Ay, Miss M'Crimman, and I'll have the sad satisfaction
of one day closing her een. Never mind, we do our duty
here, and we'll all meet again in the great "Up-bye."
But, dear boys, to continue my story&mdash;if story I dare call
it. Not far from the hills where I used to follow Laird
Glennie's sheep, and down beside a bonnie wood and
stream, was a house, of not much pretension, but tenanted
every year by a gentleman who used to paint the hills and
glens and country all round. They say he got great
praise for his pictures, and big prices as well. I used
often to arrange my sheep and dogs for him into what he
would call picturesque groups and attitudes. Then he
painted them and me and dogs and all. He used to
delight to listen to my boyish story of adventure, and in
return would tell me tales of far-off lands he had been in,
and about the Silver Land in particular. Such stories
actually fired my blood. He had sown the seeds of
ambition in my soul, and I began to long for a chance of
getting away out into the wide, wide world, and seeing all
its wonders, and, maybe, becoming a great man myself.
But how could a penniless laddie work his way abroad?
Impossible.</p>
<p>'Well, one autumn a terrible storm swept over the
country. It began with a perfect hurricane of wind, then
it settled down to rain, till it became a perfect "spate." I
had never seen such rain, nor such tearing floods as came
down from the hills.</p>
<p>'Our shieling was a good mile lower down the stream
than the artist's summer hut. It was set well up the
brae, and was safe. But on looking out next day a sight
met my eyes that quite appalled me. All the lowlands
and haughs were covered with a sea of water, down the
centre of which a mighty river was chafing and roaring,
carrying on its bosom trees up-torn from their roots,
pieces of green bank, "stooks" of corn and "coles" of hay,
and, saddest of all, the swollen bodies of sheep and oxen.
My first thought was for the artist. I ran along the bank
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
till opposite his house. Yes, there it was flooded to the
roof, to which poor Mr. Power was clinging in desperation,
expecting, doubtless, that every moment would be his last,
for great trees were surging round the house and dashing
against the tiles.</p>
<p>'Hardly knowing what I did, I waved my plaid and
shouted. He saw me, and waved his arm in response.
Then I remembered that far down stream a man kept a
boat, and I rushed away, my feet hardly seeming to touch
the ground, till I reached&mdash;not the dwelling, that was
covered, but the bank opposite; and here, to my delight,
I found old M'Kenzie seated in his coble. He laughed at
me when I proposed going to the rescue of Mr. Power.</p>
<p>'"Impossible!" he said. "Look at the force of the
stream."</p>
<p>'"But we have not to cross. We can paddle up the
edge," I insisted.</p>
<p>'He ventured at last, much to my joy. It was hard,
dangerous work, and often we found it safest to land and
haul up the boat along the side.</p>
<p>'We were opposite the artist's hut at length, hardly
even the chimney of which was now visible. But Power
was safe as yet.</p>
<p>'At the very moment our boat reached him the
chimney disappeared, and with it the artist. The turmoil
was terrible, for the whole house had collapsed. For a
time I saw nothing, then only a head and arm raised
above the foaming torrent, far down stream. I dashed in,
in spite of M'Kenzie's remonstrances, and in a minute
more I had caught the drowning man. I must have been
struck on the head by the advancing boat. That mattered
little&mdash;the sturdy old ferryman saved us both; and for a
few days the artist had the best room in mither's
shieling.</p>
<p>'And this, dear lady, turned out to be&mdash;as I dare say
you have guessed&mdash;my fairy godfather. He went back to
Buenos Ayres, taking me as servant. He is here now. I
saw him but yesterday, and we are still the fastest friends.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>'But, boys, do not let me deceive you. Mr. Power was
not rich; all he could do for me was to pay my passage
out, and let me trust to Providence for the rest.</p>
<p>'I worked at anything I could get to do for a time,
principally holding horses in the street, for you know
everybody rides here. But I felt sure enough that one
day, or some day, a settler would come who could value
the services of an honest, earnest Scottish boy.</p>
<p>'And come the settler did. He took me away, far
away to the west, to a wild country, but one that was far
too flat and level to please me, who had been bred and
born among the grand old hills of Scotland.</p>
<p>'Never mind, I worked hard, and this settler&mdash;a
Welshman he was&mdash;appreciated my value, and paid me
fairly well. The best of it was that I could save every
penny of my earnings.</p>
<p>'Yes, boys, I roughed it more than ever you'll have to
do, though remember you'll have to rough it too for a
time. You don't mind that, you say. Bravely spoken,
boys. Success in the Silver Land rarely fails to fall to
him who deserves it.</p>
<p>'Well, in course of time I knew far more about sheep
and cattle-raising than my master, so he took me as a
partner, and since then I have done well. We changed
our quarters, my partner and I. We have now an excellent
steading of houses, and a grand place for the beasts.'</p>
<p>'And to what qualities do you chiefly attribute your
success?' said my aunt.</p>
<p>'Chiefly,' replied Moncrieff, 'to good common-sense, to
honest work and perseverance. I'm going back home in
a week or two, as soon as I get married and my mither
gets the "swimming" out of her head. She says she still
feels the earth moving up and down with her; and I don't
wonder, an auld body like her doesn't stand much codging
about.</p>
<p>'Well, you see, boys, that I, like yourselves, had one
advantage to begin with. You have a bit o' siller&mdash;I got
a fairy godfather. But if I had a year to spare I'd go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
back to Scotland and lecture. I'd tell them all my own
ups and downs, and I'd end by saying that lads or young
men, with plenty of go in them and willingness to work,
will get on up country here if they can once manage to
get landed. Ay, even if they have hardly one penny to
rattle against another.</p>
<p>'Now, boys, do you care to go home with me? Mind it
is a wild border-land I live on. There are wild beasts in
the hill jungles yet, and there are wilder men&mdash;the
Indians. Yes, I've fought them before, and hope to live
to fight them once again.'</p>
<p>'I don't think <i>we'll</i> fear the Indians <i>very</i> much,' said
my bold brother Donald.</p>
<p>'And,' I added, 'we are so glad you have helped us to
solve the problem that we stood face to face with&mdash;namely,
how to begin to do something.'</p>
<p>'Well, if that is all, I'll give you plenty to do. I've
taken out with me waggon-loads of wire fencing as well as
a wife. Next week, too, I expect a ship from Glasgow to
bring me seven sturdy Scotch servant men that I picked
myself. Every one of them has legs like pillar post-offices,
hands as broad as spades, and a heart like a lion's.
And, more than all this, we are trying to form a little
colony out yonder, then we'll be able to hold our own
against all the reeving Indians that ever strode a horse.
Ah! boys, this Silver Land has a mighty future before it!
We have just to settle down a bit and work with a will
and a steady purpose, then we'll fear competition neither
with Australia nor the United States of America either.</p>
<p>'But you'll come. That's right. And now I have you
face to face with fate and fortune.</p>

<p>Yes, boys, the battle of life, and I would not give a fig for
any lad who feared to face it.</p>

up, and she'll want a cup o' tea.'</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>SHOPPING AND SHOOTING.</h3>
</div>

<p>We all went to Moncrieff's wedding, and it passed off
much the same way as do weddings in other parts of
the world. The new Mrs. Moncrieff was a very modest
and charming young person indeed, and a native of our
sister island&mdash;Ireland. I dare say Moncrieff loved his wife
very much, though there was no extra amount of romance
about his character, else he would hardly have spoken
about his wife and a truck-load of wire fencing in the
self-same sentence. But I dare say this honest Scot
believed that wire fencing was quite as much a matter of
necessity in the Silver West as a wife was.</p>
<p>As for my brothers and me, and even aunt, we were
impatient now&mdash;'burning' bold Donald called it&mdash;to get
away to this same Silver West and begin the very new
life that was before us.</p>
<p>But ships do not always arrive from England exactly to
a day; the vessel in which Moncrieff's men, dogs, goods,
and chattels were coming was delayed by contrary winds,
and was a whole fortnight behind her time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we restrained ourselves as well as we could,
and aunt went shopping. She had set her heart upon
guanaco robes or ponchos for each of us; and though they
cost a deal of money, and were, according to Moncrieff,
a quite unnecessary expense, she bought them all the same.</p>
<p>'They will last for ever, you know,' was aunt's excuse
for the extravagance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></p>
<p>'Yes,' he said, 'but we won't. Besides,' he added,
'these ponchos may bring the Gaucho malo (the bad
Gaucho) round us.'</p>
<p>'All the better,' persisted aunt. 'I've heard such a deal
about this Gaucho malo that I should very much like to
see a live specimen.'</p>
<p>Moncrieff laughed.</p>
<p>'I much prefer <i>dead</i> specimens,' he said, with that canny
twinkle in his eye. 'That's the way I like to see them
served up. It is far the safest plan.'</p>
<p>We were very fond of aunt's company, for she really
was more of a sister to us than our auntie; but for all that
we preferred going shopping with Moncrieff. The sort of
stores he was laying in gave such earnest of future sport
and wild adventure.</p>
<p>Strange places he took us to sometimes&mdash;the shop of a
half-caste Indian, for instance, a fellow from the far south
of Patagonia. Here Moncrieff bought quite a quantity of
ordinary ponchos, belts, and linen trousers of great width
with hats enough of the sombrero type to thatch a rick.
This mild and gentle savage also sold Moncrieff some
dozen of excellent lassoes and bolas as well. From the
way our friend examined the former, and tried the thong-strength
of the latter, it was evident he was an expert in
the use of both. Bolas may be briefly described as three
long leather thongs tied together at one end, and having a
ball at the free end of each. On the pampas, these balls
are as often as not simply stones tied up in bits of skin;
but the bolas now bought by Moncrieff were composed of
shining metal, to prevent their being lost on the pampas.
These bolas are waved round the heads of the horsemen
hunters when chasing ostriches, or even pumas. As soon
as the circular motion has given them impetus they are
dexterously permitted to leave the hand at a tangent, and
if well thrown go circling round the legs, or probably neck
of the animal, and bring it to the ground by tripping it
up, or strangling it.</p>
<p>The lasso hardly needs any description.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>'Can you throw that thing well?' said Dugald, his eyes
sparkling with delight.</p>
<p>'I think I can,' replied Moncrieff. 'Come to the door
and see me lasso a dog or something.'</p>
<p>Out we all went.</p>
<p>'Oh!' cried Dugald, exultingly, 'here comes little
Captain Bombazo, walking on the other side of the
street with my aunt. Can you lasso him without hurting
auntie?'</p>
<p>'I believe I can,' said Moncrieff. 'Stand by, and let's
have a good try. Whatever a man dares he can do.
Hoop là!'</p>
<p>The cord left the Scotchman's hand like a flash of lightning,
and next moment Bombazo, who at the time was
smiling and talking most volubly, was fairly noosed.</p>
<p>The boys in the street got up a cheer. Bombazo
jumped and struggled, but Moncrieff stood his ground.</p>
<p>'He must come,' he said, and sure enough, greatly to
the delight of the town urchins, Moncrieff rounded in
the slack of the rope and landed the captain most
beautifully.</p>
<p>'Ah! you beeg Scot,' said Bombazo, laughing good-humouredly.
'I would not care so mooch, if it were not
for de lady.'</p>
<p>'Oh, she won't miss you, Bombazo.'</p>
<p>'On the contraire, she veel be inconsolabeel.'</p>
<p>'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed Moncrieff. 'What a tall opinion
of yourself you have, my little friend!'</p>
<p>Bombazo drew himself up, but it hardly added an inch
to his height, and nothing to his importance.</p>
<p>Saddles of the pampas pattern the semi-savage had also
plenty of, and bridles too, and Moncrieff gave a handsome
order.</p>
<p>A more respectable and highly civilized saddler's store
was next visited, and real English gear was bought,
including two charming ladies' saddles of the newest
pattern, and a variety of rugs of various kinds.</p>
<p>Off we went next to a wholesale grocer's place. Out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
came Moncrieff's great note-book, and he soon gave
evidence that he possessed a wondrous memory, and was
a thorough man of business. He kept the shopman hard
at it for half an hour, by which time one of the pyramids
of Egypt, on a small scale, was built upon the counter.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_7' id='linki_7'></a>
<img src='images/illus098.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 605px; height: 374px;' /><br />
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></div>
<p>'Now for the draper's, and then the chemist's,' said
our friend. From the former&mdash;a Scot, like himself&mdash;he
bought a pile of goods of the better sort, but from their
appearance all warranted to wear a hundred years.</p>
<p>His visit to the druggist was of brief duration.</p>
<p>'Is my medicine chest filled?'</p>
<p>'Yes, sir, all according to your orders.'</p>
<p>'Thanks; send it, and send the bill.'</p>
<p>'Never mind about the bill, Mr. Moncrieff. You'll be
down here again.'</p>
<p>'Send the bill, all the same. And I say, Mr. Squills&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Yes, sir.'</p>
<p>'Don't forget to deduct the discount.'</p>
<p>But Moncrieff's shopping was not quite all over yet, and
the last place he went to was a gunsmith's shop.</p>
<p>And here I and my brothers learned a little about
Silver West shooting, and witnessed an exhibition that
made us marvel.</p>
<p>Moncrieff, after most careful examination, bought half
a dozen good rifles, and a dozen fowling pieces. It took
him quite a long time to select these and the ammunition.</p>
<p>'You have good judgment, sir,' said the proprietor.</p>
<p>'I require it all,' said Moncrieff. 'But now I'd look at
some revolvers.'</p>
<p>He was shown some specimens.</p>
<p>'Toys&mdash;take them away.'</p>
<p>He was shown others.</p>
<p>'Toys again. Have you nothing better?'</p>
<p>'There is nothing better made.'</p>
<p>'Very well. Your bill please. Thanks.'</p>
<p>'If you'll wait one minute,' the shopkeeper said, 'I
should feel obliged. My man has gone across the way to
a neighbour gunsmith.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>'Couldn't I go across the way myself?'</p>
<p>'No,' and the man smiled. 'I don't want to lose your
custom.'</p>
<p>'Your candour is charming. I'll wait.'</p>
<p>In a few minutes the man returned with a big basket.</p>
<p>'Ah! these are beauties,' cried Moncrieff. 'Now, can I
try one or two?'</p>
<p>'Certainly.'</p>
<p>The man led the way to the back garden of the premises.
Against a wall a target was placed, and Moncrieff loaded
and took up his position. I noticed that he kept his
elbow pretty near his side. Then he slowly raised the
weapon.</p>
<p>Crack&mdash;crack&mdash;crack! six times in all.</p>
<p>'Bravo!' cried the shopkeeper. 'Why, almost every
shot has hit the spot.'</p>
<p>Moncrieff threw the revolver towards the man as if it
had been a cricket-ball.</p>
<p>'Take off the trigger,' he said.</p>
<p>'Off the trigger, sir?'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Moncrieff, quietly; 'I seldom use the
trigger.'</p>
<p>The man obeyed. Then he handed back the weapon,
which he had loaded.</p>
<p>Moncrieff looked one moment at the target, then the
action of his arm was for all the world like that of throwing
stones or cracking a whip.</p>
<p>He seemed to bring the revolver down from his ear each
time.</p>
<p>Bang&mdash;bang&mdash;bang! and not a bullet missed the bull's-eye.</p>
<p>'How is it done?' cried Dugald, excitedly.</p>
<p>'I lift the hammer a little way with my thumb and let
it go again as I get my aim&mdash;that is all. It is a rapid way
of firing, but I don't advise you laddies to try it, or you
may blow off your heads. Besides, the aim, except in
practised hands like mine, is not so accurate. To hit well
it is better to raise the weapon. First fix your eye on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
your man's breast-button&mdash;if he has one&mdash;then elevate till
you have your sight straight, and there you are, and there
your Indian is, or your "Gaucho malo."'</p>
<p>Moncrieff pointed grimly towards the ground with his
pistol as he spoke, and Dugald gave a little shudder, as if
in reality a dead man lay there.</p>
<p>'It is very simple, you see.'</p>
<p>'Oh, Mr. Moncrieff,' said Dugald, 'I never thought you
were so terrible a man!'</p>
<p>Moncrieff laughed heartily, finished his purchases,
ordering better cartridges, as these, he said, had been
badly loaded, and made the weapon kick, and then we
left the shop.</p>
<p>'Now then, boys, I'm ready, and in two days' time
hurrah for the Silver West! Between you and me, I'm
sick of civilization.'</p>
<p>And in two days' time, sure enough, we had all started.</p>
<p>The train we were in was more like an American than
an English one. We were in a very comfortable saloon,
in which we could move about with freedom.</p>
<p>Moncrieff, as soon as we had rattled through the streets
and found ourselves out in the green, cool country, was
brimful of joy and spirits. Aunt said he reminded her
of a boy going off on a holiday. His wife, too, looked
'blithe' and cheerful, and nothing could keep his mother's
tongue from wagging.</p>
<p>Bombazo made the old lady a capital second, while
several other settlers who were going out with us&mdash;all
Scotch, by the way&mdash;did nothing but smile and wonder at
all they saw. We soon passed away for a time beyond the
region of trees into a rich green rolling country, which
gave evidence of vast wealth, and sport too. Of this
latter fact Dugald took good notice.</p>
<p>'Oh, look!' he would cry, pointing to some wild wee
lake. 'Murdoch! Donald! wouldn't you like to be at
the lochside yonder, gun in hand?'</p>
<p>And, sure enough, all kinds of feathered game were
very plentiful.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>But after a journey of five hours we left the train, and
now embarked on a passenger steamer, and so commenced
our journey up the Paraná. Does not the very name
sound musical? But I may be wrong, according to some,
in calling the Paraná beautiful, for the banks are not high;
there are no wild and rugged mountains, nor even great
forests; nevertheless, its very width, its silent moving
power, and its majesticness give it a beauty in my eye that
few rivers I know of possess. We gazed on it as the
sunset lit up its wondrous waters till an island we were
passing appeared to rise into the sky and float along in the
crimson haze. We gazed on it again ere we retired for
the night. The stars were now all out, and the river's
dark bosom was studded here and there with ripples and
buttons of light; but still it was silent, as if it hid some
dark mysterious secret which it must tell only to the
distant ocean.</p>
<p>We slept very soundly this night, for the monotonous
throb-throb of the engine's great pulse and the churning
rush of the screw not only wooed us to slumber, but
seemed to mingle even with our dreams.</p>
<p>All night long, then, we were on the river, and nearly
all next day as well. But the voyage appeared to my
brothers and me to be all too short. We neared Rosario
about sunset, and at last cast anchor. But we did not
land. We were too snug where we were, and the hotel
would have had far fewer charms.</p>
<p>To-night we had a little impromptu concert, for several
of Moncrieff's friends came on board, and, strange to say,
they were nearly all Scotch. So Scotch was spoken,
Scotch songs were sung, and on deck, to the wild notes of
the great bagpipes, Scotch reels and strathspeys were
danced. After that,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>'The nicht drave on wi' songs and clatter,'</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>till it was well into the wee short hours of the morning.</p>
<p>At Rosario we stopped for a day&mdash;more, I think,
because Moncrieff wished to give aunt and his young wife
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
a chance of seeing the place than for any business reason.
Neither my brothers nor I were very much impressed by
it, though it is a large and flourishing town, built somewhat
on Philadelphia principles, in blocks, and, like Philadelphia,
gridironed all over with tramway lines. It is a
good thing one is able to get off the marble pavements
into the cars without having far to go, for the streets are
at times mere sloughs of despond. It is the same in all
new countries.</p>
<p>Rosario lies in the midst of a flat but fertile country,
on the banks of the Paraná. The hotel where we lodged
was quite Oriental in its appearance, being built round a
beautiful square, paved with marble, and adorned with
the most lovely tropical shrubs, flowers, and climbing
plants.</p>
<p>There seems to be a flea in Rosario, however&mdash;just one
flea; but he is a most ubiquitous and a most insatiably
blood-thirsty little person. The worst of it is that, night
or day, you are never perfectly sure where he may be.
It is no use killing him either&mdash;that is simply labour
thrown away, for he appears to come to life again, and
resumes his evil courses as merrily as before.</p>
<p>Fifty times a day did I kill that flea, and Dugald said
he had slain him twice as often; but even as Dugald
spoke I could have vowed the lively <i>pulex</i> was thoroughly
enjoying a draught of my Highland blood inside my right
sock.</p>
<p>Although none of our party shed tears as we mounted
into the train, still the kindly hand-shakings and the
hearty good-byes were affecting enough; and just as the
train went puffing and groaning away from the station
they culminated in one wild Highland hurrah! repeated
three times thrice, and augmented by the dissonance of
a half-ragged crew of urchins, who must needs wave their
arms aloft and shout, without the faintest notion what it
was all about.</p>
<p>We were now <i>en route</i> for Cordoba, westward ho! by
Frayle Muerto and Villa Neuva.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>A JOURNEY THAT SEEMS LIKE A DREAM.</h3>
</div>

<p>It was towards sunset on the day we had left Rosario,
and we had made what our guard called a grand run,
though to us it was a somewhat tedious one. Moncrieff
had tucked his mother up in the plaid, and she had gone
off to sleep on the seat 'as gentle as "ewe lammie,"'
according to her son. My aunt and the young bride were
quietly talking together, and I myself was in that delightful
condition called "twixt sleeping and waking,' when suddenly
Dugald, who had been watching everything from the window,
cried, 'Oh, Donald, look here. What a lovely changing
cloud!'</p>
<p>Had Moncrieff not been busy just then&mdash;very earnestly
busy indeed&mdash;discussing the merits of some sample
packets of seeds with one of his new men, he might have
come at once and explained the mystery.</p>
<p>It was indeed a lovely cloud, and it lay low on the
north-western horizon. But we had never before seen so
strange a cloud, for not only did it increase in length and
breadth more rapidly than do most clouds, but it caught
the sun's parting rays in quite a marvellous manner.
When first we looked at it the colour throughout was a
bluish purple; suddenly it changed to a red with resplendent
border of fiery orange. Next it collapsed, getting broader
and rounder, and becoming a dark blue, almost approaching
to black, while the border beneath was orange-red. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
the glowing magnificence of the colour it is impossible to
describe in words; and the best artist would have failed
to reproduce it even were he ten times a Turner.</p>
<p>At this moment, and just as the cloud was becoming
elongated again, Moncrieff came to our side. His usually
bright face fell at once as soon as he glanced at it.</p>
<p>'Locusts!' He almost gasped the word out.</p>
<p>'Locusts!' was re-echoed from every corner of the
carriage; and immediately all eyes were strained in the
direction of our 'lofty golden cloud.'</p>
<p>As we approached nearer to it, and it came nearer to us,
even the light from the setting sun was obscured, and in a
short time we were in the cloud, and apparently part of it.
It had become almost too dark to see anything inside our
carriage, owing to that dense and awful fog of insect life.
We quickly closed the windows, for the loathsome insects
were now pattering against the glass, and many had already
obtained admittance, much to the horror of young Mrs.
Moncrieff, though aunt took matters easy enough, having
seen such sights before.</p>
<p>The train now slowly came to a standstill. Something&mdash;no
one appeared to know what&mdash;had happened on ahead
of us, and here we must wait till the line was clear. Even
Moncrieff's mother had awakened, and was looking out
with the rest of us.</p>
<p>'Dearie me! Dearie me!' she exclaimed. 'A shower
o' golochs! The very licht o' day darkened wi' the
fu'some craiters. Ca' you this a land o' milk and honey?
Egyptian darkness and showers o' golochs!'</p>
<p>We descended and walked some little distance into the
country, and the sight presented to our astonished gaze I,
for one, will not forget to my dying day. The locusts
were still around us, but were bearing away southward,
having already devastated the fields in this vicinity. But
they fell in hundreds and thousands around us; they
struck against our hands, our faces, and hats; they got
into our sleeves, and even into our pockets; and we could
not take a step without squashing them under foot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>Only an hour before we had been passing through a
country whose green fertility was something to behold
once and dream about for ever. Evidence of wealth and
contentment had been visible on all sides. Beautiful,
home-looking, comfortable <i>estancias</i> and out-buildings, fat,
sleek cattle and horses, and flocks of beautiful sheep, with
feathered fowls of every description. But here, though
there were not wanting good farmsteadings, all was desolation
and threatened famine; hardly a green blade or leaf
was left, and the woebegone looks of some of the people
we met wandering aimlessly about, dazed and almost
distracted, were pitiful to behold. I was not sorry when
a shriek from the engine warned us that it was time to
retrace our slippery footsteps.</p>
<p>'Is this a common occurrence?' I could not help asking
our friend Moncrieff.</p>
<p>He took me kindly by the arm as he replied,</p>
<p>'It's a depressing sight to a youngster, I must allow;
but we should not let our thoughts dwell on it. Sometimes
the locusts are a terrible plague, but they manage to get
over even that. Come in, and we'll light up the saloon.'</p>
<p>For hours after this the pattering continued at the
closed windows, showing that the shower of golochs had
not yet ceased to fall. But with lights inside, the carriage
looked comfortable and cheerful enough, and when presently
Moncrieff got out Bombazo's guitar and handed it to him,
and that gentleman began to sing, we soon got happy
again, and forgot even the locusts&mdash;at least, all but
Moncrieff's mother did. She had gone to sleep in a
corner, but sometimes we heard her muttering to herself,
in her dreams, about the 'land o' promise,' 'showers of
golochs,' and 'Egyptian darkness.'</p>
<p>The last thing I remember as I curled up on the floor
of the saloon, with a saddle for a pillow and a rug round
me&mdash;for the night had grown bitterly cold&mdash;was Bombazo's
merry face as he strummed on his sweet guitar and sang
of tresses dark, and love-lit eyes, and sunny Spain. This
was a delightful way of going to sleep; the awakening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
was not quite so pleasant, however, for I opened my eyes
only to see a dozen of the ugly 'golochs' on my rug, and
others asquat on the saddle, washing their faces as flies do.
I got up and went away to wash mine.</p>
<p>The sun was already high in the heavens, and on
opening a window and looking out, I found we were
passing through a woodland country, and that far away in
the west were rugged hills. Surely, then, we were nearing
the end of our journey.</p>
<p>I asked our mentor Moncrieff, and right cheerily he replied,</p>
<p>'Yes, my lad, and we'll soon be in Cordoba now.'</p>
<p>This visit of ours to Cordoba was in reality a little
pleasure trip, got up for the special delectation of our
aunt and young Mrs. Moncrieff. It formed part and
parcel of the Scotchman's honeymoon, which, it must be
allowed, was a very chequered one.</p>
<p>If the reader has a map handy he will find the name
Villa Maria thereon, a place lying between Rosario and
Cordoba. This was our station, and there we had left all
heavy baggage, including Moncrieff's people. On our
return we should once more resume travelling together
westward still by Mercedes. And thence to our destination
would be by far and away the most eventful portion
of the journey.</p>
<p>'Look out,' continued Moncrieff, 'and behold the rugged
summits of the grand old hills.'</p>
<p>'And these are the Sierras?'</p>
<p>'These are the Sierras; and doesn't the very sight of
mountains once again fill your heart with joy? Don't you
want to sing and jump&mdash;'</p>
<p>'And call aloud for joy,' said his mother, who had come
up to have a peep over our shoulders. 'Dearie me,' she
added, 'they're no half so bonny and green as the braes o'
Foudland.'</p>
<p>'Ah! mither, wait till you get to our beautiful home in
Mendoza. Ye'll be charmed wi' a' you see.'</p>
<p>'I wish,' I said, 'I was half as enthusiastic as you are,
Moncrieff.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>'You haven't been many days in the Silver Land.
Wait, lad, wait! When once you've fairly settled and can
feel at home, man, you'll think the time as short as pleasure
itself. Days and weeks flee by like winking, and every
day and every week brings its own round o' duty to
perform. And all the time you'll be makin' money as easy
as makin' slates.'</p>
<p>'Money isn't everything,' I said.</p>
<p>'No, lad, money isn't everything; but money is a deal
in this wo<i>rrr</i>ld, and we mustn't forget that money puts
the power in our hands to do others good, and that I
think is the greatest pleasure of a'. And you know,
Murdoch, that if God does put talents in our hands He
expects us to make use of them.'</p>
<p>'True enough, Moncrieff,' I said.</p>
<p>'See, see! that is Cordoba down in the hollow yonder,
among the hills. Look, mither! see how the domes and
steeples sparkle in the mornin's sunshine. Yonder dome
is the cathedral, and further off you see the observatory,
and maybe, mither, you'll have a peep through a telescope
that will bring the moon so near to you that you'll be able
to see the good folks thereon ploughin' fields and milkin'
kye.'</p>
<p>We stayed at Cordoba for four days. I felt something
of the old pleasant languor of Rio stealing over me again as
I lounged about the handsome streets, gazed on the ancient
churches and convent, and its world-renowned University,
or climbed its <i>barranca</i>, or wandered by the Rio Balmeiro,
and through the lovely and romantic suburbs. In good
sooth, Cordoba is a dreamy old place, and I felt better
for being in it. The weather was all in our favour also,
being dry, and neither hot nor cold, although it was now
winter in these regions. I was sorry to leave Cordoba, and
so I feel sure was aunt, and even old Jenny.</p>
<p>Then came the journey back to Villa Maria, and thence
away westward to Villa Mercedes. The railway to the
latter place had not long been opened.</p>
<p>It seems all like a beautiful halo&mdash;that railway ride to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
the <i>Ultima Thule</i> of the iron horse&mdash;and, like a dream, it is
but indistinctly remembered. Let me briefly catch the
salient points of this pleasant journey.</p>
<p>Villa Maria we reach in the evening. The sun is setting
in a golden haze; too golden, for it bodes rain, and presently
down it comes in a steady pour, changing the dust of the
roads into the stickiest of mud, and presently into rivers.
Moncrieff is here, there, and everywhere, seeing after
his manifold goods and chattels; but just as the short
twilight is deepening into night, he returns 'dressed
and dry,' as he calls it, to the snug little room of the
inn, where a capital dinner is spread for us, and we are
all hungry. Even old Jenny, forgetting her troubles and
travels, makes merry music with knife and fork, and
Bombazo is all smiles and chatter. It rains still; what of
that? It will drown the mosquitoes and other flying 'jerlies.'
It is even pleasant to listen to the rattle of the rain-drops
during the few lulls there were in the conversation. The
sound makes the room inside seem ever so much more
cosy. Besides, there is a fire in the grate, and, to add
to our enjoyment, Bombazo has his guitar.</p>
<p>Even the landlord takes the liberty of lingering in the
room, standing modestly beside the door, to listen. It is
long, he tells us, since he has had so cheerful a party at his
house.</p>
<p>Aileen, as Moncrieff calls his pretty bride, is not long in
discovering that the innkeeper hails from her own sweet
Isle of Sorrow, and many friendly questions are asked on
both sides.</p>
<p>Bed at last. A bright morning, the sun coming up
red and rosy through an ocean of clouds more gorgeous than
ever yet was seen in tame old England.</p>
<p>We are all astir very early. We are all merry and
hungry. Farewells are said, and by and by off we rattle.
The train moves very slowly at first, but presently warms
to her work and settles down to it. We catch a glimpse of
a town some distance off, and nearer still the silver gleam
of a river reflecting the morning sun. By and by we are on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
the river bridge, and over it, and so on and away through
an open pampa. Such, at least, I call it. Green swelling
land all around, with now and then a lake or loch swarming
with web-footed fowl, the sight of which makes Dugald's
eyes water.</p>
<p>We pass station after station, stopping at all. More
woods, more pampa; thriving fields and fertile lands;
<i>estancias</i>, flocks of sheep, herds of happy cattle. A busy,
bustling railway station, with as much noise around it as
we find at Clapham Junction; another river&mdash;the Rio
Cuarto, if my memory does not play me false; pampas
again, with hills in the distance. Wine and water-melons
at a station; more wine and more water-melons at another.</p>
<p>After this I think I fall asleep, and I wonder now if the
wine and the water-melons had anything to do with that.
I awake at last and rub my eyes. Bombazo is also dozing;
so is old Jenny. Old Jenny is a marvel to sleep. Dugald
is as bright as a humming bird; he says I have lost a
sight.</p>
<p>'What was the sight?'</p>
<p>'Oh, droves upon droves of real wild horses, wilder far
than our ponies at Coila.'</p>
<p>I close my eyes again. Dear old Coila! I wish Dugald
had not mentioned the word. It takes me back again in
one moment across the vast and mighty ocean we have
crossed to our home, to father, mother, and Flora.</p>
<p>Before long we are safe at Villa Mercedes. Not much
to see here, and the wind blows cold from west and south.</p>
<p>We are not going to lodge in the town, however. We
are independent of inns, if there are any, and independent
of everything. We are going under canvas.</p>
<p>Already our pioneers have the camp ready in a piece of
ground sheltered by a row of lordly poplars; and to-morrow
morning we start by road for the far interior.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Another glorious morning! There is a freshness in the
air which almost amounts to positive cold, and reminds one
of a November day in Scotland. Bombazo calls it bitterly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
cold, and my aunt has distributed guanaco ponchos to us,
and has adorned herself with her own. Yes, adorned is
the right word to apply to auntie's own travelling toilet;
but we brothers think we look funny in ours, and laugh at
each other in turn. Moncrieff sticks to the Highland
plaid, but the sight of a guanaco poncho to old Jenny does,
I verily believe, make her the happiest old lady in all the
Silver Land. She is mounted in the great canvas-covered
waggon, which is quite a caravan in every respect. It
has even windows in the sides and real doorways, and is
furnished inside with real sofas and Indian-made chairs, to
say nothing of hammocks and tables and a stove. This
caravan is drawn by four beautiful horses, and will be our
sitting-room and dining-room by day, and the ladies'
boudoir and bedroom for some time to come.</p>
<p>Away we rattle westwards, dozens of soldiers, half-bred
Chilians, Gauchos, and a crowd of dark-eyed but dirty
children, giving us a ringing cheer as we start.</p>
<p>What a cavalcade it is, to be sure! Waggons, drays,
carts, mules, and horses. All our imported Scotchmen are
riding, and glorious fellows they look. Each has a rifle
slung across his shoulder, belts and sheath knives, and
broad sombrero hat. The giant Moncrieff himself is riding,
and looks to me the bravest of the brave. I and each of
my brothers have undertaken to drive a cart or waggon,
and we feel men from hat to boots, and as proud all over
as a cock with silver spurs.</p>
<p>We soon leave behind us those tall, mysterious-looking
poplar trees. So tall are they that, although when we
turned out not a breath of wind was blowing on the surface
of the ground, away aloft their summits were waving gently
to and fro, with a whispering sound, as if they were talking
to unseen spirits in the sky.</p>
<p>We leave even the <i>estancias</i> behind. We are out now
on the lonesome rolling plain. Here and there are woods;
away, far away, behind us are the jagged summits of the
everlasting hills. By and by the diligence, a strange-looking
rattle-trap of a coach&mdash;a ghost of a coach, I might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
call it&mdash;goes rattling and swaying past us. Its occupants
raise a feeble cheer, to which we respond with a three
times three; for we seem to like to hear our voices.</p>
<p>After this we feel more alone than ever. On and on
and on we jog. The road is broad and fairly good; our
waggons have broad wheels; this retards our speed, but
adds to our comfort and that of the mules and horses.</p>
<p>Before very long we reach a broad river, and in we
plunge, the horsemen leading the van, with the water up
to their saddle-girths. I give the reins of my team to my
attendant Gaucho, and, running forward, jump on board
the caravan to keep the ladies company while we fight the
ford. But the ladies are in no way afraid; they are
enjoying themselves in the front of the carriage, which is
open. Old Jenny is in an easy-chair and buried to the
nose in her guanaco robe. She is muttering something
to herself, and as I bend down to listen I can catch the
words: 'Dearie me! Dearie me! When'll ever we reach
the Land o' Promise? Egyptian darkness! Showers of
golochs! Chariots and horsemen! Dearie me! Dearie
me!'</p>
<p>But we are over at last, and our whole cavalcade looks
sweeter and fresher for the bath.</p>
<p>Presently we reach a corral, where two men beckon to
Moncrieff. They are wild and uncouth enough in all
conscience; their baggy breeches and ponchos are in sad
need of repair, and a visit to a barber would add to the
respectability of their appearance. They look excited,
wave their arms, and point southwards. But they talk in
a strange jargon, and there are but two words intelligible
to me. These, however, are enough to set my heart
throbbing with a strange feeling of uneasiness I never felt
before.</p>
<p>'<i>Los Indios! Los Indios!</i>'</p>
<p>Moncrieff points significantly to his armed men and
smiles. The Gauchos wave their arms in the air, rapidly
opening and shutting their hands in a way that to me is
very mysterious. And so they disappear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>THE TRAGEDY AT THE FONDA.</h3>
</div>

<p>I could not help wondering, as I glanced at aunt
whether she had heard and understood the meaning
of those wild Gauchos' warning. If she did she made no
sign. But aunt is a M'Crimman, and the sister of a bold
Highland chief. She would not <i>show</i> fear even if she <i>felt</i>
it. Yes, the brave may feel fear, but the coward alone is
influenced by it.</p>
<p>Old Jenny had gone to sleep, so I said good-bye to aunt,
nodded to Aileen, and went back to my waggon once more.</p>
<p>We made good progress that day, though we did not
hurry. We stopped to feed our cattle, and to rest and
feed ourselves. The jolting had been terrible on some
parts of the road. But now the sun was getting very low
indeed, and as we soon came to a piece of high, hard
ground, with a view of the country round us for miles, we
determined to bivouac for the night.</p>
<p>The horses and mules were hobbled and turned off to
graze under the charge of sentry Gauchos. No fear of
their wandering off far. They were watered not an hour
ago, and would be fresh by daybreak.</p>
<p>Now, Moncrieff had been too long in the wilds to neglect
precautions while camping out. I had taken an early
opportunity to-day to interview our leader concerning the
report that Indians were abroad.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>'Ah!' he answered, 'you heard and understood what
that half-breed said, then?'</p>
<p>'Just a word or two. He appeared to give us a warning
of some kind. Is it of any account?'</p>
<p>'Well, there's always some water where the stirkie
drowns; there's always some fire where you see smoke;
and it is better to be sure than sorry.'</p>
<p>I could elicit no more information from my canny
countryman than that. I said nothing to any one, not
even my brothers. Why should I cause them the slightest
alarm, and speak a word that might tend to make them
sleep less soundly?</p>
<p>However, as soon as the halt was made, I was glad to
see that Moncrieff took every precaution against a surprise.
The caravan was made the centre of a square, the waggons
being 'laggered' around it. The fire was lit and the
dinner cooked close beside a sheltering <i>barranca</i>, and as
soon as this meal was discussed the fire was extinguished.</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>'Then came still evening on,'</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>and we all gathered together for prayer. Even the
Gauchos were summoned, though I fear paid but little
attention, while Moncrieff, standing bare-headed in the
midst of us, read a chapter from the Book by the pale
yellow light of the western sky. Then, still standing&mdash;</p>
<p>'Brothers, let us pray,' he said.</p>
<p>Erect there, with the twilight shadows falling around
him, with open eyes and face turned skywards, with the
sunset's after-glow falling on his hard but comely features,
his plaid depending from his broad shoulders, I could not
help admiring the man. His prayer&mdash;and it was but
brief&mdash;had all the trusting simplicity of a little child's,
yet it was in every way the prayer of a man communing
with his God; in every tone thereof was breathed belief,
reliance, gratitude, and faith in the Father.</p>
<p>As he finished, Dugald pressed my arm and pointed
eastwards, smiling. A star had shone out from behind a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
little cloud, and somehow it seemed to me as if it were an
angel's eye, and that it would watch over us all the live-long
night. Our evening service concluded with that
loveliest of hymns, commencing&mdash;</p>

<p>He gave it out in the old Scotch way, two lines at a time,
and to the tune 'Martyrdom.'</p>
<p>It was surely appropriate to our position and our

<p>We now prepared for rest. The sentries were set, and in a
short time all was peace and silence within our camp.
More than once during the night the collies&mdash;dogs brought
out by Moncrieff's men&mdash;gave an uneasy bark or two,
their slumbers being probably disturbed by the cry of
some night bird, or the passing of a prowling fox.</p>
<p>So, wrapped in our guanaco robes&mdash;the benefit of which
we felt now&mdash;my brothers and I slept sweetly and deeply
till the sun once more rose in the east.</p>
<p>Soon all was bustle and stir again.</p>
<p>Thus were our days spent on the road, thus our evenings,
and eke our nights. And at the end of some days we
were still safe and sound, and happy. No one sick in the
camp; no horse or mule even lame; while we were
all hardening to travel already.</p>
<p>So far, hardly anything had happened to break the even
tenour of our journey. Our progress, however, with so
much goods and chattels, and over such roads, was
necessarily slow; yet we never envied the lumbering diligence
that now and then went rattling past us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>We saw many herds of wild horses. Some of these, led
by beautiful stallions, came quite close to us. They
appeared to pity our horses and mules, condemned to the
shafts and harness, and compelled to work their weary
lives away day after day. Our beasts were slaves. They
were free&mdash;free as the breezes that blew over the pampas
and played with their long manes, as they went thundering
over the plains. We had seen several ostriches, and my
brothers and I had enjoyed a wild ride or two after them.
Once we encountered a puma, and once we saw an
armadillo. We had never clapped eyes on a living specimen
before, but there could be no mistaking the gentleman
in armour. Not that he gave us much time for
study, however. Probably the creature had been asleep
as we rounded the corner of a gravel bank, but in one
moment he became alive to his danger. Next moment we
saw nothing but a rising cloud of dust and sand; lo! the
armadillo was gone to the Antipodes, or somewhere in that
direction&mdash;buried alive. Probably the speed with which
an armadillo&mdash;there are several different species in the
Silver West&mdash;disappears at the scent of any one belonging
to the <i>genus homo</i>, is caused by the decided objection he
has to be served up as a side-dish. He is excellent
eating&mdash;tender as a chicken, juicy as a sucking-pig, but
the honour of being roasted whole and garnished is one he
does not crave.</p>
<p>Riding on ahead one day&mdash;I had soon got tired of the
monotony of driving, and preferred the saddle&mdash;at a bend
of the road I came suddenly upon two horsemen, who
had dismounted and were lying on a patch of sward
by the roadside. Their horses stood near. Both sprang
up as I appeared, and quick as lightning their hands
sought the handles of the ugly knives that depended
in sheaths from their girdles. At this moment there
was a look in the swarthy face of each that I can
only describe as diabolical. Hatred, ferocity, and cunning
were combined in that glance; but it vanished in a moment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
and the air assumed by them now was one of cringing
humility.</p>
<p>'The Gaucho malo,' I said to myself as soon as I saw
them. Their horses were there the nobler animals.
Bitted, bridled, and saddled, the latter were in the manner
usual to the country, the saddle looking like a huge
hillock of skins and rags; but rifles were slung alongside,
to say nothing of bolas and lasso. The dress of the men
was a kind of nondescript garb. Shawls round the loins,
tucked up between their legs and fastened with a girdle,
did duty as breeches; their feet were encased in <i>potro</i> boots,
made of the hock-skin of horses, while over their half-naked
shoulders hung ponchos of skin, not without a
certain amount of wild grace.</p>
<p>Something else as well as his rifle was lashed to the
saddle of one of these desert gipsies, and being new to the
country, I could not help wondering at this&mdash;namely, a
guitar in a case of skin.</p>
<p>With smiles that I knew were false one now beckoned
me to alight, while the other unslung the instrument and
began to tune it. The caravan must have been fully two
miles behind me, so that to some extent I was at the
mercy of these Gauchos, had they meant mischief. This
was not their plan of campaign, however.</p>
<p>Having neighed in recognition of the other horses, my
good nag stood as still as a statue; while, with my eyes
upon the men and my hand within easy distance of my
revolver, I listened to their music. One sang while the other
played, and I must confess that the song had a certain
fascination about it, and only the thought that I was far
from safe prevented me from thoroughly enjoying it. I
knew, as if by instinct, however, that the very fingers that
were eliciting those sweet sad tones were itching to clutch
my throat, and that the voice that thrilled my senses
could in a moment be changed into a tiger yell, with which
men like these spring upon their human prey.</p>
<p>On the whole I felt relieved when the rumble of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
waggon wheels fell once more on my ears. I rode back to
meet my people, and presently a halt was made for the
midday feed.</p>
<p>If aunt desired to feast her eyes on the Gaucho malo she
had now a chance. They played to her, sang to her, and
went through a kind of wild dance for her especial
delectation.</p>
<p>'What romantic and beautiful blackguards they are!'
was the remark she made to Moncrieff.</p>
<p>Moncrieff smiled, somewhat grimly, I thought.</p>
<p>'It's no' for nought the cland<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> whistles,' he said in his
broadest, canniest accents.</p>
<p>These Gauchos were hunting, they told Moncrieff. Had
they seen any Indians about? No, no, not an Indian.
The Indians were far, far south.</p>
<p>Aunt gave them some garments, food, and money; and,
with many bows and salaams, they mounted their steeds
and went off like the wind.</p>
<p>I noticed that throughout the remainder of the day
Moncrieff was unusually silent, and appeared to wish to be
alone. Towards evening he beckoned to me.</p>
<p>'We'll ride on ahead,' he said, 'and look for a good bit
of camping-ground.'</p>
<p>Then away we both went at a canter, but in silence.</p>
<p>We rode on and on, the ground rising gently but steadily,
until we stopped at last on a high plateau, and gazed
around us at the scene. A more bleak and desolate country
it would be impossible to imagine. One vast and semi-desert
plain, the eye relieved only by patches of algarrobo
bushes, or little lakes of water. Far ahead of us the cone
of a solitary mountain rose on the horizon, and towards
this the sun was slowly declining. Away miles in our
rear were the waggons and horses struggling up the hill.
But silence as deep as death was everywhere. Moncrieff
stretched his arm southwards.</p>
<p>'What do you see yonder, Murdo?' he said.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span></div>
<p>'I see,' I replied, after carefully scanning the rolling
plain, 'two ostriches hurrying over the pampas.'</p>
<p>'Those are not ostriches, boy. They are those same
villain Gauchos, and they are after no good. I tell you
this, that you may be prepared for anything that may
happen to-night. But look,' he added, turning his horse's
head; 'down here is a corral, and we are sure to find
water.'</p>
<p>We soon reached it. Somewhat to our surprise we
found no horses anywhere about, and no sign of life around
the little inn or <i>fonda</i> except one wretched-looking
dog.</p>
<p>As we drew up at the door and listened the stillness
felt oppressive. Moncrieff shouted. No human voice
responded; but the dog, seated on his haunches, gave vent
to a melancholy howl.</p>
<p>'Look,' I said, 'the dog's paws are red with blood. He
is wounded.'</p>
<p>'It isn't <i>his</i> blood, boy.'</p>
<p>The words thrilled me. I felt a sudden fear at my
heart, born perhaps of the death-like stillness. Ah! it
was indeed a death-like stillness, and the stillness of death
itself as well.</p>
<p>Moncrieff dismounted. I followed his example, and
together we entered the <i>fonda</i>.</p>
<p>We had not advanced a yard when we came on an
awesome sight&mdash;the dead body of a Gaucho! It lay on its
back with the arms spread out, the face hacked to pieces,
and gashes in the neck. The interior of the hut was a
chaos of wild confusion, the little furniture there was
smashed, and evidently everything of value had been
carried away. Half buried in the <i>débris</i> was the body of
a woman, and near it that of a child. Both were slashed
and disfigured, while pools of blood lay everywhere about.
Young though I was, I had seen death before in several
shapes, but never anything so ghastly and awful as this.</p>
<p>A cold shudder ran through my frame and seemed to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
pierce to the very marrow of my bones. I felt for a few
moments as if in some dreadful nightmare, and I do not
hesitate to confess that, M'Crimman and all as I am, had
those Gauchos suddenly appeared now in the doorway, I
could not have made the slightest resistance to their attack.
I should have taken my death by almost rushing on the
point of their terrible knives. But Moncrieff's calm
earnest voice restored me in a moment. At its tones I
felt raised up out of my coward self, and prepared to face
anything.</p>
<p>'Murdoch,' he said, 'this is a time for calm thought and
action.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' I answered; 'bid me do anything, and I will do
it. But come out of this awful place. I&mdash;I feel a little
faint.'</p>
<p>Together we left the blood-stained <i>fonda</i>, Moncrieff
shutting the door behind him.</p>
<p>'No other eye must look in there,' he said. 'Now,
Murdoch, listen.'</p>
<p>He paused, and I waited; his steadfast eyes bent on my
face.</p>
<p>'You are better now? You are calm, and no longer
afraid?'</p>
<p>'I am no longer afraid.'</p>
<p>'Well, I can trust <i>you</i>, and no one else. Led by those
evil fiends whom we saw to-day, the Indians will be on us
to-night in force. I will prepare to give them a warm
reception&mdash;'</p>
<p>'And I will assist,' I hastened to say.</p>
<p>'No, Murdoch, you will not be here to help us at the
commencement. I said the Indians would attack in <i>force</i>,
because they know our numbers. Those <i>malo</i> men have
been spying on us when we little thought it. They know
our strength to a gun, and they will come in a cloud that
nothing can withstand, or that nothing could withstand in
the open. But we will entrench and defend ourselves till
your return.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>'My return!'</p>
<p>'Twelve miles from here,' he went on, 'is a fort. It
contains two officers and over a score soldiers. In two
hours it will be dusk, in an hour after that the moon rises.
'Twixt twilight and moonrise you must ride to that fort
and bring assistance. Depend upon it, we can defend
ourselves till you come with your men, and you must
attack the savages in the rear. You understand?'</p>
<p>'Perfectly. But had I not better ride away at
once?'</p>
<p>'No, the Indians would waylay you. You never would
reach the frontier fort. Even if you did escape from the
chase, the knowledge that the troops were coming would
prevent them from attacking to-night.'</p>
<p>'And you want them to attack to-night?'</p>
<p>'I wish them to attack to-night. We may never be able
to give a good account of them again, but all depends on
your success.'</p>
<p>In a short time the first waggons came up. They would
have stopped, but Moncrieff beckoned them onwards.
When the last waggon had gone we mounted our horses
and slowly followed. At a stream not far distant we
watered, and once more continued our journey.</p>
<p>The road now rose rapidly, till in half an hour we were
on high ground, and here the halt was made. I could
breathe more easily now we had left that blood-stained
hollow, though well I knew the sight I had witnessed
would not leave my thoughts for years to come.</p>
<p>Everything was done as quietly and orderly as if no
cloud were hovering over us, so soon to burst. The big fire
was lit as usual, supper cooked, prayers said, and the fire
also lit in the ladies' caravan, for the nights were cold and
raw now.</p>
<p>The night began to fall. Moncrieff and I had kept our
secret to ourselves hitherto, but we could no longer conceal
from any one that there was danger in the air. Yet the
news seemed to astonish no one, not even aunt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span></p>
<p>'Dear brother,' she said to our leader, 'I read it in your
face all the afternoon.'</p>
<p>It was almost dusk now, and work was commenced in
earnest. Spades were got out, and every man worked
like a slave to entrench the whole position. The strength
that I was to leave behind me was seven-and-twenty men
all told, but this included ten Gauchos. Nevertheless,
behind trenches, with plenty of guns, revolvers, and
ammunition, they were powerful enough to defend the
position against hundreds of badly-armed Indians. Not far
off was a patch of wood which stretched downwards into a
rocky ravine. Luckily it lay on the north side of the road,
and hither, as soon as it was dark enough, every horse and
mule was led and secured to the trees. Nor even in this
extremity of danger were their wants forgotten, for grass
mixed with grains was placed in front of each.</p>
<p>My horse was now led round. Each hoof was encased in
a new and strong <i>potro</i> boot, secured by thongs around the
legs.</p>
<p>'You must neither be heard nor seen,' said Moncrieff, as
he pointed to these. 'Now, good-night, boy; God be wi'
ye, and with us all!'</p>
<p>'Amen!' I responded, earnestly.</p>
<p>Then away I rode in silence, through the starlight; but
as I looked back to the camp my heart gave an uneasy
throb. Should I ever see them alive again?

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>ATTACK BY PAMPA INDIANS.</h3>
</div>

<p>So lonesome a ride in the darkness of night, through a
country wild and bleak, with danger lurking perhaps
on either side of me, might easily have daunted a bolder
heart than mine.</p>
<p>Something of the unspeakable feeling of dread I had
experienced in the <i>fonda</i> while surrounded by those awful
corpses came back to me now. I tried to banish it, but
failed. My nervousness became extreme, and appeared to
increase rather than diminish as I left the camp farther
and farther behind me. It was almost a superstitious fear
that had gotten possession of my soul. It was fear of the
unseen; and even at this distance of time I can only say I
would willingly face death in open day a hundred times
over rather than endure for an hour the terrors I suffered
that night. Every bush I saw I took for a figure lurking
by the roadside, while solitary trees I had to pass assumed
the form and shape and even movement of an enemy on
horseback riding silently down to meet me. Again and
again I clutched my revolver, and even now I cannot tell
what power prevented me from firing at my phantom
foes. Over and over again I reined up to listen, and at
such times the wind whispering through the tall grass
sounded to me like human voices, while the cry of birds
that now and then rose startlingly close to me, made my
heart beat with a violence that in itself was painful.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>Sometimes I closed my eyes, and gave the horse his
head, trying to carry my thoughts back to the lights of the
camp, or forward to the fort which I hoped soon to reach.</p>
<p>I had ridden thus probably five good miles, when I
ventured to look behind me, and so great had been the
strain on my nerves that the sight I now witnessed almost
paralyzed me.</p>
<p>It was the reflection as of a great fire on the brow of the
hill where my people were beleaguered.</p>
<p>'The camp is already attacked, and in flames,' I muttered.
Whither should I ride now&mdash;backwards or forwards?</p>
<p>While I yet hesitated the flames appeared to wax fiercer
and fiercer, till presently&mdash;oh, joy!&mdash;a big round moon
gradually shook itself clear of a cloud and began slowly to
climb the eastern sky.</p>
<p>All fear fled now. I muttered a prayer of thankfulness,
dashed the spurs into my good horse's sides, and went on
at the gallop.</p>
<p>The time seemed short after this, and almost before I
knew I came right upon the fort, and was challenged by the
sentry.</p>
<p>'<i>Amigo!</i>' I yelled. '<i>Amigo! Angleese!</i>'</p>
<p>I dare say I was understood, for soon after lights appeared
on the ramparts, and I was hailed again, this time in
English, or for what passed as English. I rode up under
the ramparts, and quickly told my tale.</p>
<p>In ten minutes more I was received within the fort. A
tumble-down place I found it, but I was overjoyed to be
in it, nevertheless. In the principal room most of the men
were playing games, and smoking and talking, while the
commandant himself lounged about with a cigarette in his
mouth.</p>
<p>He considered for a minute or two&mdash;an age it appeared
to me&mdash;ere he answered. Yes; he would come, and take
with him fifteen soldiers, leaving the rest to guard the
fort. I could have embraced him, so joyful did I feel on
hearing these words.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>How long would he be? One hour, no more. For arms
had to be cleaned, and ammunition to be got ready; and
the men must feed.</p>
<p>A whole hour! No wonder I sighed and looked anxious.
Why, every minute was precious to my poor beleaguered
friends. It would be long past midnight ere I reached
the camp again, for these men would not be mounted.
Yet I saw the good little commander was doing his best,
not only to expedite matters, but to treat me with kindness
and hospitality. He brought forth food and wine, and
forced me to eat and drink. I did so to please him; but
when he proposed a game to pass the time, I began to
think the man was crazed. He was not. No; but
possessed a soldierly virtue which I could not boast of&mdash;namely,
patience.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The work of entrenchment was soon completed after my
departure; then there was nothing more to be done except
to appoint the men to their quarters, place sentinels on the
highest of the waggons, and wait.</p>
<p>Ah, but this waiting is a weary thing under circumstances
like the present&mdash;waiting and watching, not knowing from
what quarter the attack will come, what form it will take,
or when it will commence.</p>
<p>Except in the chief caravan itself, where Moncrieff and
Donald sat for a time to keep up the hearts of the ladies,
no lights were lit.</p>
<p>There was no singing to-night, hardly a smile on any
face, and no one spoke much above a whisper. Poor old
Jenny had gone to sleep, as usual.</p>
<p>'Wake me,' had been her last words. 'Wake me, laddie,
when the Philistines are upon us.'</p>
<p>'The old lady's a marvel!' Moncrieff had whispered to
aunt.</p>
<p>Moncrieff was doing all he could to keep conversation
alive, though, strange to say, Bombazo seldom spoke.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
Surely he could not be afraid. Moncrieff had his suspicions.
Brave as my aunt was, the waiting made her nervous.</p>
<p>'Hark!' she would say every now and then; or, 'Listen!
What was that?'</p>
<p>'Only the cry of a burrowing owl,' Moncrieff might have
to answer; or, 'Only the yap of a prowling fox.' Oh, the
waiting, the weary waiting!</p>
<p>The moon rose at last, and presently it was almost as
light as day.</p>
<p>'Will they come soon, think you?' whispered poor
Aileen.</p>
<p>'No, darling; not for hours yet. Believe me there is
no danger. We are well prepared.'</p>
<p>'Oh, Alec, Alec!' she answered, bursting into tears; 'it
is you I fear for, not myself. Let me go with you when
they come. I would not then be afraid; but waiting
here&mdash;oh, it is the waiting that takes all the heart out of
me.'</p>
<p>'Egyptian darkness!' murmured the old lady in her
sleep. Then in louder, wilder key, 'Smite them!' she
exclaimed. 'Smite this host of the Philistines from Gideon
to Gaza.'</p>
<p>'Dear old mither, she's dreaming,' said Moncrieff.
'But, oh, we'll laugh at all this by to-morrow night, Aileen,
my darling.'</p>
<p>One hour, two hours went slowly, painfully past. The
moon mounted higher and higher, and shone clearer and
clearer, but not yet on all the plains were there signs of a
mounted Indian.</p>
<p>Yet even at that moment, little though our people knew
it, swarthy forms were creeping stealthily through the
pampas grass, with spears and guns at trail, pausing often
to glance towards the camp they meant so soon to surprise
and capture.</p>
<p>The moon gets yet brighter. Moncrieff is watching.
Shading his eyes from the light, he is gazing across the
marsh and listening to every sound. Not a quarter of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
mile away is a little marshy lake. From behind it for
several minutes he has heard mournful cries. They
proceed from the burrowing owls; but they must have
been startled! They even fly towards the camp, as if to
give warning of the approach of the swarthy foe.</p>
<p>Suddenly from the edge of the lake a sound like the
blast of a trumpet is heard; another and another, and
finally a chorus of trumpet notes; and shortly after a flock
of huge flamingoes are seen wheeling in the moonlit air.</p>
<p>'It is as I thought,' says Moncrieff; 'they are creeping
through the grass. Hurry round, Dugald, and call the men
quietly to quarters.'</p>
<p>Moncrieff himself, rifle in hand, climbs up to the top of
the waggon.</p>
<p>'Go down now,' he tells the sentry. 'I mean to fire
the first shot.'</p>
<p>He lies down to wait and watch. No bloodhound could
have a better eye. Presently he sees a dark form raise itself
near a tussock of grass. There is a sharp report, and
the figure springs into the air, then falls dead on the
pampas.</p>
<p>No need for the foe to conceal themselves any longer.
With a wild and unearthly scream, that the very earth
itself seems to re-echo, they spring from their hiding and
advance at the double towards the fort&mdash;for fort it is now. As
they come yelling on they fire recklessly towards it. They
might as well fire in the air.</p>
<p>Moncrieff's bold Doric is heard, and to some purpose, at
this juncture.</p>
<p>'Keep weel down, men! Keep weel to cove<i>rrr</i>! Fire
never a shot till he has the o<i>rr</i>der. Let every bullet have
its billet. Ready! Fire-<i>r</i>-<i>r</i>-<i>r</i>!'</p>
<p>Moncrieff rattled out the <i>r</i>'s indefinitely, and the rifles
rattled out at the same time. So well aimed was the volley
that the dark cloud seemed staggered. The savages
wavered for a time, but on they came again, redoubling
their yells. They fired again, then, dropping their guns,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
rushed on towards the breastwork spears in hand. It was
thus that the conflict commenced in dread earnest, and the
revolvers now did fearful execution. The Indians were
hurled back again and again, and finally they broke and
sought cover in the bush. Their wounded lay writhing
and crying out close beneath the rampart, and among these
were also many who would never move more in this
world.</p>
<p>On seeing the savages take to the bush, Moncrieff's anxiety
knew no bounds. The danger of their discovering the
horses was extreme. And if they did so, revenge would
speedily follow defeat. They would either drive them
away across the pampas, or in their wrath slaughter them
where they stood.</p>
<p>What was to be done to avert so great a catastrophe?
A forlorn hope was speedily formed, and this my two brothers
volunteered to lead. On the first shout heard down in
the hollow&mdash;indicating the finding of our horses&mdash;Donald,
Dugald, and fifteen men were to rush out and turn the flank
of the swarthy army if they could, or die in the attempt.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, however, the enemy appeared bent on trying
cunning and desperate tactics. They were heard cutting
down the bushes and smaller trees, and not long afterwards
it looked as if the whole wood was advancing bodily up towards
the breastwork on that side.</p>
<p>A rapid and no doubt effective fire was now kept up by
Moncrieff and his men. This delayed the terrible <i>dénoûment</i>,
but it was soon apparent that if some more strategic
movement was not made on our part it could not wholly
thwart it.</p>
<p>At all hazards that advancing wood must be checked,
else the horrors of fire would be the prelude to one of the
most awful massacres that ever took place on the lonely
pampas.</p>
<p>'How is the wind?' asked Moncrieff, as if speaking to
himself.</p>
<p>'It blows from the wood towards the camp,' said Dugald,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
'but not quite in a line. See, I am ready to rush out and
fire that pile.'</p>
<p>'No, Dugald,' cried Donald; 'I am the elder&mdash;I will
go.'</p>
<p>'Brother, I spoke first.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Moncrieff, quietly, 'Dugald must go, and go
now. Take five men, ten if you want them.'</p>
<p>'Five will do&mdash;five Gauchos,' said Dugald.</p>
<p>It was wise of Dugald to choose Gauchos. If the truth
must be told, however, he did so to spare more valuable
lives. But these wild plainsmen are the bravest of the
brave, and are far better versed in the tactics of Indian
warfare than any white man could be.</p>
<p>Dugald's plan would have been to issue out and make a
bold rush across the open space of seventy and odd yards
that intervened between the moving pile of brushwood
and the camp. Had this been done, every man would
have been speared ere he got half across.</p>
<p>The preparations for the sally were speedily made. Each
man had a revolver and knife in his belt, and carried in
his hands matches, a bundle of <i>pob</i> (or tarred yarn), and
a small cask of petroleum oil. They issued from the side
of the camp farthest from the wood, and, crawling on their
faces, took advantage of every tussock of grass, waving
thistle, or hemlock bush in their way. Meanwhile a
persistent fire was kept up from behind the breastwork,
which, from the screams and yells proceeding from the
savages, must have been doing execution.</p>
<p>Presently, close behind the bush and near the ground,
Moncrieff could see Dugald's signal, the waving of a white
handkerchief, and firing immediately ceased.</p>
<p>Almost immediately afterwards smoke and flames ran
all along the wood and increased every moment. There
was a smart volley of revolver firing, and in a minute more
Dugald and his Gauchos were safe again within the fort.</p>
<p>'Stand by now, lads, to defend the ramparts!' cried
Moncrieff; 'the worst is yet to come.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>The worst was indeed to come. For under cover of the
smoke the Indians now made ready for their final assault.
In the few minutes of silence that elapsed before the
attack, the voice of a Gaucho malo was heard haranguing
his men in language that could not but inflame their blood
and passions. He spoke of the riches, the wealth of the
camp, of the revenge they were going to have on the hated
white man who had stolen their hunting fields, and driven
them to the barren plains and mountains to seek for food
with the puma and the snake, and finally began to talk of
the pale-face prisoners that would become their possession.</p>
<p>'Give them another volley, men,' said Moncrieff, grimly.
'Fire low through the smoke.'</p>
<p>It would have been better, probably, had our leader
waited.</p>
<p>Little need to precipitate an onslaught that could have
but one ending&mdash;unless indeed assistance arrived from the
fort.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The long, long hour of waiting came to an end at last,
and the commander and myself left the frontier fort at the
head of the men.</p>
<p>How terribly tedious the march back seemed! The
officer would keep talking as cheerfully as if going to a
concert or evening party. I hardly answered, I hardly
heard him. I felt ashamed of my anxiety, but still I
could not help it. I was but a young soldier.</p>
<p>At last we are within sight, ay, and hearing, of the camp,
and the events of the next hour float before my memory
now as I write, like the shadowy pantomime of some terrible
dream.</p>
<p>First we see smoke and fire, but hear no sound. All
must be over, I think&mdash;tragedy and massacre, all&mdash;and the
camp is on fire.</p>
<p>Even the commander of our little force takes a serious
view of the case now. He draws his sword, looks to his
revolver, and speaks to his men in calm, determined tones.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>For long minutes the silence round the camp is unbroken,
but suddenly rifles ring out in the still air, and I breathe
more freely once again. Then the firing ceases, and is
succeeded by the wild war-cries of the attacking savages,
and the hoarse, defiant slogan of the defending Scots.</p>
<p>'Hurrah!' I shout, 'we are yet in time. Oh, good sir,
hurry on! Listen!'</p>
<p>Well might I say listen, for now high above the yell of
savages and ring of revolvers rises the shriek of frightened
women.</p>
<p>I can stand this no longer. I set spur to my horse, and
go dashing on towards the camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>THE FLIGHT AND THE CHASE.</h3>
</div>

<p>The very last thing I had seen that cool Argentine
commander do, was to light a fresh cigarette with the
stump of the old one. The next time I saw him, he was
standing by his wounded horse, in the moonlight, with a
spear wound in his brow, but smoking still.</p>
<p>The onslaught of the savages had been for a while a
terrible one, but the soldiers came in time, and the camp
was saved.</p>
<p>Hardly knowing what I did&mdash;not knowing till this day
how I did it&mdash;I had put my good steed at the breastwork,
and, tired though he was, he fairly cleared it. Next I
remember hewing my way, sword in hand, through a crowd
of spear-armed savages, finding myself close to the ladies'
caravan, and next minute inside it.</p>
<p>A single glance showed me all were safe. Aileen lay
pale and motionless on the sofa. Near her, revolver in
hand, stood my brave aunt, and by the stove was old Jenny
herself.</p>
<p>'Oh, bless you, dear boy!' cried auntie. 'How glad
we are to see you!'</p>
<p>"Deed are we, laddie!' chimed old Jenny; 'but&mdash;' and
she grinned as she spoke, 'they rievin' Philistines will be
fools if they come this road again. I've gi'en some o' them
het [hot] hurdies. Ha, ha! I'm makin' a drap mair for
them in case they come again.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span></p>
<p>'Poor thing!' I think; 'she has gone demented.'</p>
<p>There was no time now, however, to ask for explanation;
for although the Indians had really been driven off, the
chase, and, woe is me, the slaughter, had commenced.</p>
<p>And I shudder even yet when I think of that night's
awful work on the moonlit pampas. Still, the sacrifice of
so many redskins was calculated to insure our safety.
Moreover, had our camp fallen into the hands of those
terrible Indians, what a blood-blotted page would have
been added to the history of the Silver West!</p>
<p>It is but just and fair to Moncrieff, however, to say that
he did all in his power to stay the pursuit; but in vain.
The soldiers were just returning, tired and breathless, from
a fruitless chase after the now panic-stricken enemy, when
a wild shout was heard, and our Gauchos were seen riding
up from the woods, brandishing the very spears they had
captured from the Indians, and each one leading a spare
horse.</p>
<p>The <i>soldados</i> welcomed them with a shout. Next
minute each was mounted and galloping across the pampas
in one long extended line.</p>
<p>They were going to treat the Indians to a taste of their own
tactics, for between each horse a lasso rope was fastened.</p>
<p>All our men who were safe and unwounded now
clambered into the waggon to witness the pursuit. Nothing
could exceed the mad grandeur of that charge&mdash;nothing
could withstand that wild rash. The Indians were mowed
down by the lasso lines, then all we could see was a dark
commingled mass of rearing horses, of waving swords and
spears, and struggling, writhing men.</p>
<p>Yells and screams died away at last, and no sound was
now heard on the pampas except the thunder of the horses'
hoofs, as our people returned to the camp, and occasionally
the trumpet-like notes of the startled flamingoes.</p>
<p>As soon as daylight began to appear in the east the
ramparts were razed, and soon after we were once more on
the move, glad to leave the scene of battle and carnage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>From higher ground, at some distance, I turned and
looked back. Already the air was darkened by flocks of
pampas kites, among them many slow-winged vultures, and
I knew the awful feast that ever follows slaughter had
already commenced.</p>
<p>We had several Gauchos killed and one of our own
countrymen, but many more were wounded, some severely
enough, so that our victory had cost us dear, and yet we
had reason to be thankful, and my only surprise to this day
is that we escaped utter annihilation.</p>
<p>It would be anything but fair to pass on to other scenes
without mentioning the part poor old Jenny played in the
defence of the caravan.</p>
<p>Jenny was not demented&mdash;not she. Neither the fatigue
of the journey, the many wonders she had witnessed,
including the shower of golochs, nor the raid upon the camp
had deprived Moncrieff's wonderful mither of her wits.
I have said there was a stove burning in the caravan. As
soon, then, as Jenny found out that they were fortifying or
entrenching the camp, and that the Philistines, as she called
them, might be expected at any moment, she awoke to a
true sense of the situation. The first thing she did was to
replenish the fire, then she put the biggest saucepan on top
of the stove, and as soon as it commenced to boil she began
'mealing in,' as she called it.</p>
<p>'Oatmeal would have been best,' she told my aunt; 'but,
after a',' she added, 'Indian meal, though it be but
feckless stuff, is the kind o' kail they blackamoors are maist
used to.'</p>
<p>Aunt wondered what she meant, but was silent, and,
indeed, she had other things to think about than Jenny
and her strange doings, for Aileen required all her
attention.</p>
<div class='figcenter'>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span></div>
<p>When, however, the fight had reached its very fiercest,
when the camp itself was enveloped in smoke, and the
constant cracking of revolvers, the shrieks of the wounded
men and clashing of weapons would have daunted a less
bold heart than Jenny's&mdash;the old lady took her saucepan
from the stove and stationed herself by the front door of
the caravan. She had not long to wait. Three of the
fiercest of the Indian warriors had sprung to the <i>coupé</i> and
were half up,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>'But little kenned they Jenny's mettle,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Or dreamt what lay in Jenny's kettle.'</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>With eyes that seemed to flash living fire, her grey hair
streaming over her shoulders, she must have looked a
perfect fury as she rushed out and deluged the up-turned
faces and shoulders of the savages with the boiling mess.
They dropped yelling to the ground, and Jenny at once
turned her attention to the back door of the van, where
already one of the leading Gaucho malos&mdash;aunt's beautiful
blackguards of the day before&mdash;had gained footing. This
villain she fairly bonneted with the saucepan.</p>
<p>'Your brithers have gotten the big half o' the kail,' she
cried, 'and ye can claw the pat.'</p>
<p>It was not till next evening that aunt told Moncrieff the
brave part old Jenny had played. He smiled in his quiet
way as he patted his mother's hand.</p>
<p>'Just as I told ye, Miss M'Crimman,' he said; 'mither's
a ma<i>rrr</i>vel!'</p>
<p>But where had the bold Bombazo been during the
conflict? Sword and revolver in hand, in the foremost
ranks, and wherever the battle raged the fiercest? Nay,
reader, nay. The stern truth remains to be told. During
all the terrible tulzie Bombazo had never once been either
seen or heard. Nor could he be anywhere found after the
fight, nor even after the camp was struck, though search
was made for him high and low.</p>
<p>Some one suggested that he might have been overcome
by fear, and might have hidden himself. Moncrieff looked
incredulous. What! the bold Bombazo be afraid&mdash;the
hero of a hundred fights, the slayer of lions, the terror of
the redskins, the brave hunter of pampas and prairie?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
Captain Rodrigo de Bombazo hide himself? Yet where
could he be? Among the slain? No. Taken prisoner?
Alas! for the noble redman. Those who had escaped would
hardly have thought of taking prisoners. Bombazo's name
was shouted, the wood was searched, the waggons
overhauled, not a stone was left unturned, figuratively
speaking, yet all in vain.</p>
<p>But, wonderful to relate, what <i>men</i> failed to do a <i>dog</i>
accomplished. An honest collie found Bombazo&mdash;actually
scraped him up out of the sand, where he lay buried, with
his head in a tussock of grass. It would be unfair to judge
him too harshly, wrong not to listen to his vouchsafed
explanation; yet, sooth to say, to this very day I believe
the little man had hidden himself after the manner of the
armadillos.</p>
<p>'Where is my sword?' he shouted, staggering to his feet.
'Where is the foe?'</p>
<p>The Scotchmen and even the Gauchos laughed in his
face. He turned from them scornfully on his heel and
addressed Moncrieff.</p>
<p>'Dey tried to keel me,' he cried. 'Dey stunned me and
covered me up wit' sand. But here I am, and now I seek
revenge. Ha! ha! I will seek revenge!'</p>
<p>Old Jenny could stand it no longer.</p>
<p>'Oh, ye shameless sinner!' she roared. 'Oh, ye feckless
fusionless winner! Let me at him. <i>I'll</i> gie him revenge.'</p>
<p>There was no restraining Jenny. With a yell like the
war cry of a clucking hen, she waved her umbrella aloft,
and went straight for the hero.</p>
<p>The blow intended for his head alighted lower down.
Bombazo turned and fled, pursued by the remorseless
Jenny; and not even once did she miss her aim till the
terror of the redskins, to save his own skin, had taken
refuge beneath the caravan.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>As at sea, so in travelling. Day after day, amid scenes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
that are for ever new, the constantly recurring adventure
and incident suffice to banish even thoughts of the dead
themselves. But neither seafarers nor travellers need
be ashamed of this; it is only natural. God never
condemns His creatures to constant sorrow. The brave
fellows, the honest Scot and the Gauchos, that we had
laid side by side in one grave in the little burying-place
at the frontier fort, were gone beyond recall. No amount
of sorrowing could bring them back. We but hoped they
were happier now than even we were, and so we spoke of
them no more; and in a week's time everything about our
caravan and camp resumed its wonted appearance, and we
no longer feared the Indians.</p>
<p>One Gaucho, however, had escaped, and there was still
the probability he might seek for revenge some other
day.</p>
<p>We have left the bleak pampas land, although now and
then we come to bare prairie land but scantily furnished with
even bushes, and destitute of grass; houses and <i>estancias</i>
become more frequent, and <i>fondas</i> too, but nothing like that
fearful <i>fonda</i> in the prairie&mdash;the scene of the massacre.</p>
<p>We have passed through San Lui&mdash;too wretched a place
to say much about; and even La Paz and Santa Rosa; and
on taking her usual seat one forenoon in front of the
caravan, old Jenny's eyes grew bright and sparkling with
very delight.</p>
<p>'Saw anybody ever the like o' that?' she cried, as she
raised both her hands and eyes cloudwards. But it was
not the clouds old Jenny was marvelling at&mdash;for here we
were in the Province of Mendoza, and a measurable
distance from the beautiful city itself; and instead of the
barren lands we had recently emerged from, beheld a
scene of such natural loveliness and fertility, that we
seemed to have suddenly dropped into a new world.</p>
<p>The sky was blue and almost cloudless; winter though it
was, the fields were clad in emerald green; the trees, the
vineyards, the verandahed houses, the comfortable dwellings,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
the cattle, the sheep, and flocks of poultry&mdash;all testified
to the fact that in summer this must indeed be a
paradise.</p>
<p>'What do you think of all this, mither?' said Moncrieff,
with a happy smile. He was riding close to the caravan
<i>coupé</i>.</p>
<p>'Think o' it, laddie! Loshie me, laddie! it beats the
braes o' Foudlan'! It is surely the garden o' Eden we're
coming to at last.'</p>
<p>It was shortly after this that Moncrieff went galloping
on ahead. We could see him miles and miles away, for the
road was as straight as one of the avenues in some English
lord's domains. Suddenly he disappeared. Had the
earth swallowed him up? Not quite. He had merely
struck into a side path, and here we too turned with our
whole cavalcade; and our road now lay away across a still
fertile but far more open country. After keeping to
this road for miles, we turned off once more and headed
for the distant mountains, whose snow-clad, rugged tops
formed so grand a horizon to the landscape.</p>
<p>On we journey for many a long hour, and the sun goes
down and down in the west, and sinks at last behind the
hills; and oh, with what ineffably sweet tints and shades
of pink and blue and purple his farewell rays paint the
summits!</p>
<p>Twilight is beginning to fall, and great bats are flitting
about. We come within sight of a wide and well-watered
valley; and in the very centre thereof, and near a broad
lagoon which reminds us somewhat of dear old Coila, stands
a handsome <i>estancia</i> and farmyard. There are rows and
rows of gigantic poplar-trees everywhere in this glen, and
the house itself&mdash;mansion, I might almost say&mdash;lies in the
midst of a cloud of trees the names of which we cannot
even guess. There was altogether such a home-like look
about the valley, that I knew at once our long, long
journey was over, and our weary wanderings finished for a
time. There was not a very great deal of romance in honest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
Moncrieff's nature, but as he pointed with outstretched
arm to the beautiful <i>estancia</i> by the lake, and said, briefly,
'Mither, there's your hame!' I felt sure and certain those
blue eyes of his were moist with tears, and that there was
the slightest perceptible waver in his manly voice.</p>
<p>But, behold! they have seen us already at the <i>estancia</i>.</p>
<p>There is a hurrying and scurrying to and fro, and out
and in. We notice this, although the figures we see look
no larger than ants, so clear and transparent is even the
gloaming air in this wonderful new land of ours.</p>
<p>By and by we see these same figures on horseback,
coming away from the farm, and hurrying down the road
towards us. One, two, three, six! Why, there must be
well-nigh a score of them altogether. Nearer and nearer
they come, and now we see their arms wave. Nearer still,
and we hear them shout; and now at length they are on
us, with us, and around us, waving their caps, laughing,
talking, and shaking hands over and over again&mdash;as often
as not twice or thrice with the same person. Verily they
are half delirious with joy and wholly hysterical.</p>
<p>What volleys of questions have to be asked and
answered! What volumes of news to get and to give! What
hurrying here and there and up and down to admire the
new horses and mules, the new waggons and caravan&mdash;to
admire everything! while the half-frightened looks those
sturdy, sun-browned, bearded men cast at auntie and
Aileen were positively comical to witness!</p>
<p>Then, when the first wave of joyous excitement had
partially expended itself&mdash;</p>
<p>'Stand back, boys!' shouted Moncrieff's partner, a bold-faced
little Welshman, with hair and beard just on the
turn; 'stand back, my lads, and give them one more little
cheer.'</p>
<p>But was it a little cheer? Nay, but a mighty rattling
cheer&mdash;a cheer that could have issued only from brave
British throats; a cheer that I almost expected to hear
re-echoed back from the distant mountains.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>Ah! but it <i>was</i> echoed back. Echoed by us, the
new-comers, and with interest too, our faithful Gauchos
swelling the chorus with their shrill but not unmusical
voices.</p>
<p>But look! more people are coming down the road. The
welcome home is not half over yet. Yonder are the lads
and lasses, English, Irish, Castilian and Scotch, who have
no horses to ride. Foremost among them is a Highlander
in tartan trews and bagpipes. And if the welcome these
give us is not altogether so boisterous it is none the less
sincere.</p>
<p>In another hour we are all safe at home. All and everything
appears to us very strange at first, but we soon settle
down, and if we marvelled at the outside of Moncrieff's
mansion, the interior of it excites our wonder to even a
greater degree. Who could have credited the brawny
Scot with so much refinement of taste? The rooms were
large, the windows were bowers, and bowers of beauty too,
around which climbed and trailed&mdash;winter though it was&mdash;flowers
of such strange shapes and lovely colours that the
best of our floral favourites in this country would look tame
beside them. None of the walls were papered, but all
were painted, and many had pictures in light, airy and
elegant frames. The furniture too was all light and
elegant, and quite Oriental in appearance. Oriental did I
say? Nay, but even better; it was Occidental. One room
in particular took my aunt's fancy. This was to be the
boudoir, and everything in it was the work of Indian
hands. It opened on to a charming trellised verandah,
and thence was a beautiful garden which to-night was lit up
with coloured lanterns, and on the whole looked like a
scene in some Eastern fairy tale.</p>
<p>'And would you believe it, Aileen,' said Moncrieff, when
he was done showing us round the rooms; 'would you
believe it, auntie, when I came here first my good partner
and I had no place to live in for years but a reed shanty, a
butt and a ben, mither mine, with never a stick of furniture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
in it, and neither a chair nor stool nor table worth the
name?'</p>
<p>'That is so, Miss M'Crimman,' said the partner,
Mr. Jones. 'And I think my dear friend Moncrieff will
let the ladies see the sort of place we lived in.'</p>
<p>'This way, then, ladies,' said the big Scot. He seized a
huge naphtha lamp as he spoke, and strode before them
through the garden. Arrived at the end of it they came
to a strange little hut built apparently of mud and straw.</p>
<p>With little ceremony he kicked open the rickety door,
and made them enter. Both aunt and Aileen did so,
marvelling much to find themselves in a room not ten feet
wide, and neither round nor square. The roof was
blackened rafters and straw, the floor was hardened clay.
A bed&mdash;a very rude one&mdash;stood in one corner. It was
supported by horses' bones; the table in the centre was but
a barrel lid raised on crossed bones.</p>
<p>'Won't you sit down, ladies?' said Moncrieff, smiling.</p>
<p>He pointed to a seat as he spoke. It was formed of
horses' skulls.</p>
<p>Aunt smiled too, but immediately after looked suddenly
serious, gathered her dress round her with a little shudder,
and backed towards the door.</p>
<p>'Come away,' she said; 'I've seen enough.'</p>
<p>What she had seen more particularly was an awful-looking
crimson and grey spider as big as a soft-shell crab.
He was squatting on a bone in one corner, glaring at her
with his little evil eyes, and moving his horizontal
mandibles as if he would dearly like to eat her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>LIFE ON AN ARGENTINE ESTANCIA.</h3>
</div>

<p>I verily believe that Britons, whether English, Irish,
or Scotch, are all born to wander, and born colonists.
There really seems to be something in the very air of a
new land, be it Australia, America, or the Silver West,
that brings all their very best and noblest qualities to the
surface, and oftentimes makes men&mdash;bold, hardy, persevering
men&mdash;of individuals who, had they stayed in this
old cut-and-dry country, would never have been anything
better than louts or Johnnie Raws. I assure the reader
that I speak from long experience when I make these
remarks, and on any Saturday evening when I happen to
be in London, and see poor young fellows coming home to
garrets, perhaps with their pittance in their pockets, I feel
for them from the very depths of my soul. And sometimes
I sigh and murmur to myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>'Oh dear me!' I say, 'if my purse were only half as
big as my heart, wouldn't I quickly gather together a
thousand of these white slaves and sail merrily off with
them to the Land of the Silver West! And men would
learn to laugh there who hardly ever smiled before, and
tendons would wax wiry, and muscles hard, and pale faces
grow brown with the tints of health. And health would
mean work, and work would mean wealth, and&mdash;but,
heigho! what is the good of dreaming? Only some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
day&mdash;yes, <i>some</i> day&mdash;and what a glorious sunrise it will be for
this empire&mdash;Government will see its way to grant free
passages to far-off lands, in which there is peace and
plenty, work and food for all, and where the bread one eats
is never damped by falling tears. God send that happy
day! And send it soon!</p>
<p>It is the memory of our first months and years of a
downright pleasant life that makes me write like this.
We poor lads&mdash;my brothers and I&mdash;poor, but determined,
found everything so enjoyable at our new home in the Silver
West that oftentimes we could not help wishing that
thousands of toiling mortals from Glasgow and other great
overcrowded cities would only come out somehow and
share our posy. For really, to put it in plain and simple
language, next to the delight of enjoying anything oneself,
should it only be an apple, is the pleasure of seeing
one's neighbour have a bite.</p>
<p>Now here is a funny thing, but it is a fact. The air of
Mendoza is so wonderfully dry and strong and bracing that
it makes men of boys in a very short time, and makes old
people young again. It might not smooth away wrinkles
from the face, or turn grey hair brown, or even make two
hairs grow where only one grew before; but it does most
assuredly rejuvenate the heart, and shakes all the wrinkles
out of that. Out here it is no uncommon thing for the
once rheumatic to learn to dance, while stiff-jointed individuals
who immigrated with crutches under their arms,
pitch these crutches into the irrigation canals, and take to
spades and guns instead.</p>
<p>It is something in the air, I think, that works these
wondrous changes, though I am sure I could not say what.
It may be oxygen in double doses, or it may be ozone, or
even laughing gas; but there it is, and whosoever reads
these lines and doubts what I say, has only to take flight
for the beautiful province of Mendoza, and he shall remain
a sceptic no longer.</p>
<p>Well, as soon as we got over the fatigues of our long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
journey, and began to realize the fact that we were no
longer children of the desert, no longer nomads and
gipsies, my brothers and I set to work with a hearty good-will
that astonished even ourselves. In preparing our new
homes we, and all the other settlers of this infant colony
as well, enjoyed the same kind of pleasure that Robinson
Crusoe must have done when he and his man Friday set
up house for themselves in the island of Juan Fernandez.</p>
<p>Even the labourers or 'hands' whom Moncrieff had
imported had their own dwellings to erect, but instead of
looking upon this as a hardship, they said that this was
the fun of the thing, and that it was precisely here where
the laugh came in.</p>
<p>Moreover they worked for themselves out of hours, and
I dare say that is more than any of them would have done
in the old country.</p>
<p>Never once was the labour of the <i>estancia</i> neglected,
nor the state of the aqueducts, nor Moncrieff's flocks and
herds, nor his fences.</p>
<p>Some of these men had been ploughmen, others shepherds,
but every one of them was an artisan more or less,
and it is just such men that do well&mdash;men who know a
good deal about country life, and can deftly use the spade,
the hoe, the rake, the fork, as well as the hammer, the
axe, the saw, and the plane. Thanks to the way dear
father had brought us up, my brothers and I were handy
with all sorts of tools, and we were rather proud than
otherwise of our handicraft.</p>
<p>I remember that Dugald one day, as we sat at table,
after looking at his hands&mdash;they had become awfully
brown&mdash;suddenly said to Moncrieff,</p>
<p>'Oh, by the by, Brother Moncrieff, there is one thing
that I'm ready to wager you forgot to bring out with you
from England.'</p>
<p>'What was that?' said Moncrieff, looking quite serious.</p>
<p>'Why, a supply of kid gloves, white and coloured.'</p>
<p>We all laughed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>'My dear boy,' said this huge brother of ours, 'the sun
supplies the kid gloves, and it strikes me, lad, you've a
pair of coloured ones already.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Dugald, 'black-and-tan.'</p>
<p>'But, dear laddies,' old Jenny put in, 'if ye really wad
like mittens, I'll shortly shank a curn for ye.'</p>
<p>'Just listen to the old braid Scotch tongue o' that
mither o' moine&mdash;"shortly shank a curn."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Who but an
Aberdonian could understand that?'</p>
<p>But indeed poor old Jenny was a marvel with her
'shank,' as she called her knitting, and almost every
third day she turned off a splendid pair of rough woollen
stockings for one or other of her bairns, as she termed
us generically. And useful weather-defiant articles of
hosiery they were too. When our legs were encased in
these, our feet protected by a pair of double-soled boots,
and our ankles further fortified by leather gaiters, there
were few snakes even we were afraid to tackle.</p>
<p>The very word 'snake,' or 'serpent,' makes some people
shudder, and it is as well to say a word or two about these
ophidians here, and have done with them. I have, then,
no very wild adventures to record concerning those we
encountered on our <i>estancias</i>. Nor were either my
brothers or myself much afraid of them, for a snake&mdash;this
is my firm belief&mdash;will never strike a human being
except in self-defence; and, of all the thousands killed
annually in India itself by ophidians, most of the victims
have been tramping about with naked feet, or naked legs
at least.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Independent of the pure, wholesome, bracing air, there
appeared to us to be another peculiarity in the climate
which is worthy of note. It is <i>calmative</i>. There is more
in that simple sentence than might at first be imagined,
and the effect upon settlers might be best explained by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
giving an example: A young man, then, comes to this
glorious country fresh from all the excitement and fever
of Europe, where people are, as a rule, overcrowded and
elbowing each other for a share of the bread that is not
sufficient to feed all; he settles down, either to steady
work under a master, or to till his own farm and mind his
own flocks. In either case, while feeling labour to be not
only a pleasure, but actually a luxury, there is no heat of
blood and brain; there is no occasion to either chase or
hurry. Life now is not like a game of football on Rugby
lines&mdash;all scurry, push, and perspiration. The new-comer's
prospects are everything that could be desired,
and&mdash;mark this&mdash;<i>he does not live for the future any more
than the present</i>. There is enough of everything around
him <i>now</i>, so that his happiness does not consist in building
upon the far-off <i>then</i>, which strugglers in this Britain of
ours think so much about. The settler then, I say, be he
young or old, can afford to enjoy himself to-day, certain in
his own mind that to-morrow will provide for itself.</p>
<p>But this calmness of mind, which really is a symptom
of glorious health, never merges into the dreamy laziness
and ignoble activity exhibited by Brazilians in the east
and north of him.</p>
<p>My brothers and I were happily saved a good deal of
business worry in connection with the purchase of our
<i>estancia</i>, so, too, were the new settlers, for Moncrieff, with
that long Scotch head of his, had everything cut and dry,
as he called it, so that the signing of a few papers and the
writing of a cheque or two made us as proud as any
Scottish laird in the old country.</p>
<p>'You must creep before you walk,' Moncrieff told us;
'you mustn't go like a bull at a gate. Just look before
you "loup."'</p>
<p>So we consulted him in everything.</p>
<p>Suppose, for instance, we wanted another mule or horse,
we went to Moncrieff for advice.</p>
<p>'Can you do without it?' he would say. 'Go home
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
and settle that question between you, and if you find you
can't, come and tell me, and I'll let you have the beast
as cheap as you can buy it anywhere.'</p>
<p>Well, we started building our houses. Unlike the
pampas, Mendoza <i>can</i> boast of stone and brick, and even
wood, though round our district a deal of this had been
planted. The woods that lay on Moncrieff's colony had
been reared more for shelter to the flocks against the
storms and tempests that often sweep over the
country.</p>
<p>In the more immediate vicinity of the dwelling-houses,
with the exception of some splendid elms and plane-trees,
and the steeple-high solemn-looking poplar, no great
growth of wood was encouraged. For it must be
remembered we were living in what Moncrieff called
uncanny times. The Indians<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> were still a power in the
country, and their invasions were looked for periodically.
The State did not then give the protection against this
foe it does now. True, there existed what were called
by courtesy frontier forts; they were supposed to billet
soldiers there, too, but as these men were often destitute
of a supply of ammunition, and spent much of their time
playing cards and drinking the cheap wines of the country,
the settlers put but little faith in them, and the wandering
pampa Indians treated them with disdain.</p>
<p>Our houses, then, for safety's sake, were all built pretty
close together, and on high ground, so that we had a good
view all over the beautiful valley. They could thus be
more easily defended.</p>
<p>Here and there over the <i>estancias</i>, <i>puestos</i>, as they were
called, were erected for the convenience of the shepherds.
They were mere huts, but, nevertheless, they were far
more comfortable in every way than many a crofter's
cottage in the Scottish Highlands.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>Round the dwellings of the new settlers, which were
built in the form of a square, each square, three in all,
having a communication, a rampart and ditch were
constructed. The making of these was mere pastime to
these hardy Scots, and they took great delight in the
work, for not only would it enable them to sleep in peace
and safety, but the keeping of it in thorough decorative
repair, as house agents say, would always form a pleasant
occupation for spare time.</p>
<p>The mansion, as Moncrieff's beautiful house came to be
called, was similarly fortified, but as it stood high in its
grounds the rampart did not hide the building. Moreover,
the latter was partially decorated inside with flowers, and
the external embankment always kept as green as an
English lawn in June.</p>
<p>The ditches were wide and deep, and were so arranged
that in case of invasion they could be filled with water
from a natural lake high up on the brae lands. For that
matter they might have been filled at any time, or kept
filled, but Moncrieff had an idea&mdash;and probably he was
right&mdash;that too much stagnant, or even semi-stagnant
water near a house rendered it unhealthy.</p>
<p>As soon as we had bought our claims and marked them
out, each settler's distinct from the other, but ours&mdash;my
brothers' and mine&mdash;all in one lot, we commenced work
in earnest. There was room and to spare for us all
about the Moncrieff mansion and farmyard, we&mdash;the
M'Crimmans&mdash;being guests for a time, and living indoors,
the others roughing it as best they could in the out-houses,
some of which were turned into temporary huts.</p>
<p>Nothing could exceed the beauty of Moncrieff's <i>estancia</i>.
It was miles and miles in extent, and more like a lovely
garden than anything else. The fields were all square.
Round each, in tasteful rows, waved noble trees, the weird
and ghostly poplar, whose topmost branches touched the
clouds apparently, the wide-spreading elm, the shapely
chestnut, the dark, mysterious cypress, the fairy-leaved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
acacia, the waving willow and sturdy oak. These trees
had been planted with great taste and judgment around
the fields, and between all stretched hedges of laurel,
willow, and various kinds of shrubs. The fields themselves
were not without trees; in fact, trees were dotted
over most of them, notably chestnuts, and many species
of fruit trees.</p>
<p>But something else added to the extreme beauty of
these fields, namely, the irrigation canals&mdash;I prefer the
word canals to ditches. The highest of all was very deep
and wide, and was supplied with water from the distant
hills and river, while in its turn it supplied the whole
irrigation system of the <i>estancia</i>. The plan for irrigating
the fields was the simplest that could be thought of, but
it was quite as perfect as it was simple.</p>
<p>Add to the beauty of the trees and hedges the brilliancy
of trailing flowers of gorgeous hues and strange, fantastic
shapes; let some of those trees be actually hanging
gardens of beauty; let flowers float ever on the waters
around the fields, and the fields themselves be emerald
green&mdash;then imagine sunshine, balmy air, and perfume
everywhere, and you will have some idea of the charm
spread from end to end of Moncrieff's great <i>estancia</i>.</p>
<p>But there was another kind of beauty about it which I
have not yet mentioned&mdash;namely, its flocks and herds and
poultry.</p>
<p>A feature of the strath, or valley, occupied by this little
Scoto-Welsh colony was the sandhills or dunes.</p>
<p>'Do you call those sandhills?' I said to Moncrieff one
day, shortly after our arrival. 'Why, they are as green
and bonnie as the Broad Hill on the links of Aberdeen.'</p>
<p>Moncrieff smiled, but looked pleased.</p>
<p>'Man!' he replied, 'did you ever hear of the proverb
that speaks about making mountains of mole-hills? Well,
that's what I've done up yonder. When my partner and I
began serious work on these fields of ours, those bits of
hills were a constant trouble and menace to us. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
were just as big then, maybe, as they are now&mdash;about fifty
feet high at the highest, perhaps, but they were bare sandy
hillocks, constantly changing shape and even position with
every big storm, till a happy thought struck my partner,
and we chose just the right season for acting on it. We
got the Gauchos to gather for us pecks and bushels of all
kinds of wild seed, especially that of the long-rooted
grasses, and these we sowed all over the mole-hills, as we
called them, and we planted bushes here and there, and
also in the hollows, and, lo! the mole-hills were changed
into fairy little mountains, and the bits o' glens between
into bosky dells.'</p>
<p>'Dear Brother Moncrieff,' I said, 'you are a genius, and
I'm so glad I met you. What would I have been without
you?'</p>
<p>'Twaddle, man! nonsensical havers and twaddle! If
you hadn't met me you would have met somebody else;
and if you hadn't met him, you would have foregathered
wi' experience; and, man, experience is the best teacher
in a' the wide worruld.'</p>
<p>In laying out and planning our farm, my brothers and I
determined, however, not to wait for experience of our
own, but just take advantage of Moncrieff's. That would
sustain us, as the oak sustains the ivy.

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>WE BUILD OUR HOUSE AND LAY OUT GARDENS.</h3>
</div>

<p>About a hundred yards to the left of the buildings
erected for the new colony and down near the lake,
or laguna, was an elevated piece of ground about an acre
in extent. It was bounded on two sides by water, which
would thus form for it a kind of natural protection
in case of Indian invasion. It really was part and parcel
of Moncrieff's claim or land, and at an early date in his
career, thinking probably it might come in handy some
day for a site on which to build, he had taken considerable
pains to plant it with rows of beautiful trees, especially
on the sides next the water and facing the west.</p>
<p>My brothers and I arranged to have this, and Moncrieff
was well pleased to have us so near to him. A more
excellent position for a house could hardly be, and we
determined it should be a good substantial one, and of as
great architectural beauty as possible.</p>
<p>Having therefore laid out our farm proper, and stocked
it with sheep and cattle, positioned our shepherds, and
installed our labourers and general servants under the
charge of a <i>capataz</i>, or working bailiff, we turned our
attention to the erection of our house, or mansion, as
Dugald grandly called it.</p>
<p>'Of course you will cut your coat according to your cloth,'
said Moncrieff, as he came one evening into the room we
had set apart for our private study. He had found us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
to-night with our heads all together over a huge sheet of
paper on which we were planning out our house.</p>
<p>'Oh yes,' said Donald, 'that we must do.'</p>
<p>'But,' said Dugald, 'we do not expect to remain all our
lives downright poor settlers.'</p>
<p>'That I am sure you won't.'</p>
<p>'Well, I propose building a much bigger house than we
really want, so that when we do get a bit rich we can
furnish it and set up&mdash;set up&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Set up a carriage and pair, eh?' said Donald, who was
very matter of fact&mdash;'a carriage and pair, Dugald, a
billiard-room, Turkey carpets, woven all in one piece, a
cellar of old wine, a butler in black and flunkeys in plush&mdash;is
that your notion?'</p>
<p>Donald and I laughed, and Dugald looked cross.</p>
<p>Moncrieff did not laugh: he had too much tact, and was
far too kind-hearted to throw cold water over our young
brother's ambitions and aspirations.</p>
<p>'And what sort of a house do you propose?' he said to us.</p>
<p>As he spoke he took a chair at Dugald's side of the table
and put his arm gently across the boy's shoulders. There
was very much in this simple act, and I feel sure Dugald
loved him for it, and felt he had some one to assist his
schemes.</p>
<p>'Oh,' replied Donald, 'a small tasteful cottage. That
would suit well for the present, I think. What do you
think, Murdoch?'</p>
<p>'I think with you,' I replied.</p>
<p>After having heard Moncrieff speaking so much about
cutting coats according to cloth and looking before 'louping,'
and all the rest of it, we were hardly prepared to hear him
on the present occasion say boldly,</p>
<p>'And <i>I</i> think with Dugald.'</p>
<p>'Bravo, Moncrieff!' cried Dugald. 'I felt sure&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Bide a wee, though, lad. Ca' canny.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Now listen, the
lot o' ye. Ye see, Murdoch man, your proposed cottage
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
would cost a good bit of money and time and trouble, and
when you thought of a bigger place, down that cottage
must come, with an expense of more time and more
trouble, even allowing that money was of little object.
Besides, where are you going to live after your cottage is
knocked down and while your mansion is building? So I
say Dugald is right to some extent. Begin building your
big house bit by bit.'</p>
<p>'In wings?'</p>
<p>'Preceesely, sirs; ye can add and add as you like, and as
you can afford it.'</p>
<p>It was now our time to cry, 'Bravo, Moncrieff!'</p>
<p>'I wonder, Donald, we didn't think of this plan.'</p>
<p>'Ah,' said Moncrieff, 'ye canna put young he'ds on auld
shoulders, as my mither says.'</p>
<p>So Moncrieff's plan was finally adopted&mdash;we would build
our house wing by wing.</p>
<p>It took us weeks, however, to decide in what particular
style of architecture it should be built. Among the literature
which Moncrieff had brought out from England with him
was a whole library in itself of the bound volumes of
good magazines; and it was from a picture in one of these
that we finally decided what our Coila Villa should be like,
though, of course, the plan would be slightly altered to
suit circumstances of climate, &amp;c. It was to be&mdash;briefly
stated&mdash;a winged bungalow of only one story, with a
handsome square tower and portico in the centre, and
verandahs nearly all round. So one wing and the tower was
commenced at once. But bricks were to be made, and
timber cut and dried and fashioned, and no end of other
things were to be accomplished before we actually set about
the erection.</p>
<p>To do all these things we appointed a little army of
Gauchos, with two or three handy men-of-all-work from
Scotland.</p>
<p>Meanwhile our villa gardens were planned and our
bushes and trees were planted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>Terraces, too, were contrived to face the lake, and Dugald
one evening proposed a boat-house and boat, and this was
carried without a dissentient voice.</p>
<p>Dugald was extremely fond of our sister Flora. We only
wondered that he now spoke about her so seldom. But if
he spoke but little of her he thought the more, and we could
see that all his plans for the beautification and adornment
of the villa had but one end and object&mdash;the delight and
gratification of its future little mistress.</p>
<p>Dear old Dugald! he had such a kind lump of a heart
of his own, and never took any of our chaff and banter
unpleasantly. But I am quite sure that as far as he himself
was concerned he never would have troubled himself about
even the boat-house or the terraced gardens either, for
every idle hour that he could spare he spent on the hill, as
he called it, with his dog&mdash;a lovely Irish setter&mdash;and his
gun.</p>
<p>I met him one morning going off as usual with Dash, the
setter, close beside the little mule he rode, and with his
gun slung over his back.</p>
<p>'Where away, old man?' I said.</p>
<p>'Only to a little laguna I've found among the hills, and
I mean to have a grand bag to-day.'</p>
<p>'Well, you're off early!'</p>
<p>'Yes; there is little to be done at home, and there are
some rare fine ducks up yonder.'</p>
<p>'You'll be back to luncheon?'</p>
<p>'I'll try. If not, don't wait.'</p>
<p>'Not likely; ta-ta! Good luck to you! But you really
ought to have a Gaucho with you.'</p>
<p>'Nonsense, Murdoch! I don't need a groom. Dash and
old Tootsie, the mule, are all I want.'</p>
<p>It was the end of winter, or rather beginning of spring,
but Moncrieff had not yet declared close time, and Dugald
managed to supply the larder with more species of game
than we could tell the names of. Birds, especially, he
brought home on his saddle and in his bag; birds of all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
sizes, from the little luscious dove to the black swan itself;
and one day he actually came along up the avenue with a
dead ostrich. He could ride that mule of his anywhere.
I believe he could have ridden along the parapet of London
Bridge, so we were never surprised to see Dugald draw
rein at the lower sitting-room window, within the verandah.
He was always laughing and merry and mischievous-looking
when he had had extra good luck; but the day
he landed that ostrich he was fairly wild with excitement.
The body of it was given to the Gauchos, and they
made very merry over it: invited their friends, in fact,
and roasted the huge bird whole out of doors. They did so
in true Patagonian fashion&mdash;to wit, the ostrich was first
trussed and cleaned, a roaring fire of wood having been
made, round stones were made almost red-hot. The stones
were for stuffing, though this kind of stuffing is not very
eatable, but it helps to cook the bird. The fire was then
raked away, and the dinner laid down and covered up.
Meanwhile the Gauchos, male and female, girls and boys,
had a dance. The ubiquitous guitars, of course, were the
instruments, and two of these made not a bad little
band. After dinner they danced again, and wound up by
wishing Dugald all the good luck in the world, and plenty
more ostriches. The feathers of this big game-bird were
carefully packed and sent home to mother and Flora.</p>
<p>Well, we had got so used to Dugald's solitary ways that
we never thought anything of even his somewhat prolonged
absence on the hill, for he usually dropped round when
luncheon was pretty nearly done. There was always
something kept warm for 'old Dugald,' as we all called him,
and I declare it did every one of us good to see him eat.
His appetite was certainly the proverbial appetite of a
hunter.</p>
<p>On this particular day, however, old Dugald did not
return to luncheon.</p>
<p>'Perhaps,' said Donald, 'he is dining with some of the
shepherds, or having "a pick at a priest's," as he calls it.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>'Perhaps,' I said musingly. The afternoon wore away,
and there were no signs of our brother coming, so I began
to get rather uneasy, and spoke to Donald about it.</p>
<p>'He may have met with an accident,' I said, 'or fifty
things may have happened.'</p>
<p>'Well,' replied Donald, 'I don't suppose fifty things have
happened; but as you seem a bit anxious, suppose we
mount our mules, take a Gaucho with us, and institute a
search expedition?'</p>
<p>'I'm willing,' I cried, jumping up, 'and here's for off!'</p>
<p>There was going to be an extra good dinner that day,
because we expected letters from home, and our runner
would be back from the distant post-office in good time to
let us read our epistles before the gong sounded and so
discuss them at table.</p>
<p>'Hurry up, boys; don't be late, mind!' cried aunt, as our
mules were brought round to the portico, and we were
mounted.</p>
<p>'All right, auntie dear!' replied Donald, waving his
hand; 'and mind those partridges are done to a turn;
we'll be all delightfully hungry.'</p>
<p>The Gaucho knew all Dugald's trails well, and when we
mentioned the small distant laguna, he set out at once in
the direction of the glen. He made so many windings,
however, and took so many different turns through bush
and grass and scrub, that we began to wonder however
Dugald could have found the road.</p>
<p>But Dugald had a way of his own of getting back through
even a cactus labyrinth. It was a very simple one, too.
He never 'loaded up,' as he termed it; that is, he did not
hang his game to his saddle till he meant to start for home;
then he mounted, whistled to Dash, who capered and
barked in front of the mule, permitted the reins to lie
loosely on the animal's neck, and&mdash;there he was! For not
only did the good beast take him safely back to Coila, as
we called our <i>estancia</i>, but he took him by the best roads;
and even when he seemed to Dugald's human sense to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
going absolutely and entirely wrong, he never argued with
him.</p>

<p>'You are certain he will come this way, Zambo?' I
said to our Gaucho.</p>
<p>'Plenty certain, señor. I follow de trail now.'</p>
<p>I looked over my saddle-bow; so did Donald, but no trail
could we see&mdash;only the hard, yellow, sandy gravel.</p>
<p>We came at last to the hilly regions. It was exceedingly
quiet and still here; hardly a creature of any kind to be
seen except now and then a kite, or even condor, the latter
winging his silent way to the distant mountains. At
times we passed a biscacha village. The biscacha is not a
tribe of Indians, but, like the coney, a very feeble people,
who dwell in caves or burrow underground, but all day
long may be seen playing about the mounds they raise, or
sitting on their hind legs on top of them. They are really
a species of prairie-dog. With them invariably live a tribe
of little owls&mdash;the burrowing owls&mdash;and it seems to be a
mutual understanding that the owls have the principal
possession of these residential chambers by day, while the
biscachas occupy them by night. This arrangement answers
wonderfully well, and I have proved over and over again
that they are exceedingly fond of each other. The biscachas
themselves are not very demonstrative, either in their fun
or affection, but if one of them be killed, and is lying dead
outside the burrow, the poor owl often exhibits the most
frantic grief for the murder of his little housekeeper, and
will even show signs of a desire to attack the animal&mdash;especially
if a dog&mdash;which has caused his affliction.</p>
<p>Donald and I, with our guide, now reached the land of
the giant cacti. We all at home here in Britain know
something of the beauty of the common prickly cactus that
grows in window-gardens or in hot-houses, and surprises
us with the crimson glory of its flowers, which grow from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
such odd parts of the plant; but here we were in the land
of the cacti. Dugald knew it well, and used to tell us all
about them; so tall, so stately, so strange and weird, that
we felt as if in another planet. Already the bloom was on
some of them&mdash;for in this country flowers soon hear the
voice of spring&mdash;but in the proper season nothing that ever
I beheld can surpass the gorgeous beauty of these giant
cacti.</p>
<p>The sun began to sink uncomfortably low down on the
horizon, and my anxiety increased every minute. Why did
not Dugald meet us? Why did we not even hear the
sound of his gun, for the Gaucho told us we were close to
the laguna?</p>
<p>Presently the cacti disappeared behind us, and we found
ourselves in open ground, with here and there a tall, weird-looking
tree. How those trees&mdash;they were not natives&mdash;had
come there we were at first at a loss to understand, but
when we reached the foot of a grass-grown hill or sand dune,
and came suddenly on the ruins of what appeared a Jesuit
hermitage or monastery, the mystery was explained.</p>
<p>On rounding a spur of this hill, lo! the lake; and not far
from the foot of a tree, behold! our truant brother. Beside
him was Dash, and not a great way off, tied to a dwarf
algaroba tree, stood the mule. Dugald was sitting on the
ground, with his gun over his arm, gazing up into the tree.</p>
<p>'Dugald! Dugald!' I cried.</p>
<p>But Dugald never moved his head. Was he dead, or
were these green sand dunes fairy hillocks, and my brother
enchanted?</p>
<p>I leapt off my mule, and, rifle in hand, went on by
myself, never taking my eyes off my brother, and with
my heart playing pit-a-pat against my ribs.</p>
<p>'Dugald!' I said again.</p>
<p>He never moved.</p>
<p>'Dugald, speak!'</p>
<p>He spoke now almost in a stage whisper:</p>
<p>'A lion in the tree. Have you your rifle?'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>I beckoned to my brother to come on, and at the same
moment the monster gave voice. I was near enough now
to take aim at the puma; he was lying in a cat-like attitude
on one of the highest limbs. But the angry growl and the
moving tail told me plainly enough he was preparing to
spring, and spring on Dugald. It was the first wild beast
I had ever drawn bead upon, and I confess it was a supreme
moment; oh, not of joy, but,&mdash;shall I say it?&mdash;fear.</p>
<p>What if I should miss!</p>
<p>But there was no time for cogitation. I raised my rifle.
At the self-same moment, as if knowing his danger, the
brute sprang off the bough. The bullet met him in mid-air,
and&mdash;<i>he fell dead at Dugald's feet</i>.</p>
<p>The ball had entered the neck and gone right on and
through the heart. One coughing roar, an opening and
shutting of the terrible jaws&mdash;which were covered with
blood and froth&mdash;and a few convulsive movements of the
hind legs, and all was over.</p>
<p>'Thank Heaven, you are saved, dear old Dugald!' I
cried.</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Dugald, getting up and coolly stretching
himself; 'but you've been a precious long time in
coming.'</p>
<p>'And you were waiting for us?'</p>
<p>'I couldn't get away. I was sitting here when I noticed
the lion. Dash and I were having a bit of lunch. My
cartridges are all on the mule, so I've been staring fixedly
at that monster ever since. I knew it was my only chance.
If I had moved away, or even turned my head, he would
have had me as sure as&mdash;'</p>
<p>'But, I say,' he added, touching the dead puma with his
foot, '<i>isn't</i> he a fine fellow? What a splendid skin to send
home to Flora!'</p>
<p>This shows what sort of a boy Brother Dugald was; and
now that all danger was past and gone, although I
pretended to be angry with him for his rashness, I really
could not help smiling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>'But what a crack shot you are, Murdoch!' he added;
'I had no idea&mdash;I&mdash;I really couldn't have done much
better myself.'</p>
<p>'Well, Dugald,' I replied, 'I may do better next time,
but to tell the truth I aimed at the beast <i>when he was on
the branch</i>.'</p>
<p>'And hit him ten feet below it. Ha! ha! ha!'</p>
<p>We all laughed now. We could afford it.</p>
<p>The Gaucho whipped the puma out of his skin in less
than a minute, and off we started for home.</p>
<p>I was the hero of the evening; though Dugald never told
them of my funny aim. Bombazo, who had long since
recovered his spirits, was well to the front with stories of
his own personal prowess and narrow escapes; but while
relating these he never addressed old Jenny, for the ancient
and humorsome dame had told him one day that 'big lees
were thrown awa' upon her.'</p>
<p>What a happy evening we spent, for our Gaucho runner
had brought</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>SUMMER IN THE SILVER WEST.</h3>
</div>

<p>Though it really was not so very long since we had
said farewell to our friends in Scotland and the dear
ones at home, it seemed an age. So it is no wonder, seeing
that all were well, our letters brought us joy. Not for
weeks did we cease to read them over and over again and
talk about them. One of mine was from Archie Bateman,
and, much to my delight and that of my brothers, he told
us that he had never ceased worrying his father and
mother to let him come out to the Silver West and join
us, and that they were yielding fast. He meant, he said,
to put the screw on a little harder soon, by running away
and taking a cruise as far as Newcastle-on-Tyne in a coal-boat.
He had no doubt that this would have the desired
effect of showing his dearly-beloved <i>pater et mater</i> that he
was in downright earnest in his desire to go abroad. So
we were to expect him next summer&mdash;'that is,' he added,
'summer in England, and winter with you.'</p>
<p>Another letter of mine was from Irene M'Rae. I dare
say there must have been a deal of romance about me
even then, for Irene's delightful little matter-of-fact and
prosaic letter gave me much pleasure, and I&mdash;I believe I
carried it about with me till it was all frayed at every fold,
and I finally stowed it away in my desk.</p>
<p>Flora wrote to us all, with a postscript in addition to
Dugald. And we were to make haste and get rich enough
to send for pa and ma and her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></p>
<p>I did not see Townley's letter to aunt, but I know that
much of it related to the 'Coila crime,' as we all call it
now. The scoundrel M'Rae had disappeared, and Mr.
Townley had failed to trace him. But he could wait.
He would not get tired. It was as certain as Fate that as
soon as the poacher spent his money&mdash;and fellows like
him could not keep money long&mdash;he would appear again
at Coila, to extort more by begging or threatening.
Townley had a watch set for him, and as soon as he should
appear there would be an interview.</p>
<p>'It would,' the letter went on, 'aid my case very much
indeed could I but find the men who assisted him to
restore the vault in the old ruin. But they, too, are
spirited away, apparently, and all I can do fails to find
them. But I live in hope. The good time is bound to
come, and may Heaven in justice send it soon!'</p>
<p>Moncrieff had no letters, but I am bound to say that he
was as much delighted to see us happy as if we were
indeed his own brothers, and our aunt his aunt, if such a
thing could have been possible.</p>
<p>But meanwhile the building of our Coila Villa moved
on apace, and only those situated as we were could understand
the eager interest we took in its gradual rise. At
the laying of the foundation-stone we gave all the servants
and workmen, and settlers, new and old, an entertainment.
We had not an ostrich to roast whole this time, but the
supper placed before our guests under Moncrieff's biggest
tent was one his cook might well have been proud of.
After supper music commenced, only on this special and
auspicious occasion the guitars did not have it all their
own way, having to give place every now and then to the
inspiring strains of the Highland bagpipes. That was a
night which was long remembered in our little colony.</p>
<p>While the villa was being built our furniture was being
made. This, like that in Moncrieff's mansion, was all, or
mostly, Indian work, and manufactured by our half-caste
Gauchos. The wood chiefly used was algaroba, which,
when polished, looked as bright as mahogany, and quite as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
beautiful. This Occidental furniture, as we called it, was
really very light and elegant, the seats of the couches,
fauteuils and sofas, and chairs being worked with thongs,
or pieces of hardened skin, in quite a marvellous manner.</p>
<p>We had fences to make all round our fields, and hedges
to plant, and even trees. Then there was the whole
irrigation system to see to, and the land to sow with grain
and lucerne, after the soil had been duly ploughed and attended
to. All this kept us young fellows very busy
indeed, for we worked with the men almost constantly, not
only as simple superintendents, but as labourers.</p>
<p>Yes, the duties about an <i>estancia</i>, even after it is fairly
established, are very varied; but, nevertheless, I know of
no part of the world where the soil responds more quickly
or more kindly to the work of the tiller than it does in the
Silver West. And this is all the more wonderful when
we consider that a great part of the land hereabouts is by
nature barren in the extreme.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>I do not think I am wrong in saying that sheep, if not
first introduced into the <i>estancias</i> of the Silver West by the
Scotch, have at all events been elevated to the rank of
a special feature of produce in the country by them.
Moncrieff had done much for the improvement of the
breed, not only as regards actual size of body, but in
regard to the texture of the wool; and it was his proudest
boast to be able to say that the land of his adoption
could already compare favourably with Australia itself, and
that in the immediate future it was bound to beat that
island.</p>
<p>It is no wonder, therefore, that we all looked forward to
our first great shearing as a very busy time indeed. Our
great wool harvest was, indeed, one of the principal events
of the year. Moncrieff said he always felt young again at
the sheep-shearing times.</p>
<p>Now there are various styles of wool harvesting.
Moncrieff's was simple enough. Preparations were made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
for it, both out-doors and in, at least a fortnight beforehand.
Indoors, hams, &amp;c., were got ready for cooking, and
the big tent was erected once more near and behind the
mansion, for extra hands to the number of twenty at least
were to be imported; several neighbour settlers&mdash;they
lived ten miles off, and still were neighbours&mdash;were coming
over to lend a hand, and all had to eat, and most had to
sleep, under canvas.</p>
<p>If sheep-shearing prospects made Moncrieff young again,
so they did his mother. She was here, there, and everywhere;
now in parlour or dining-room, in kitchen and
scullery, in out-houses and tent, giving orders, leading,
directing, ay, and sometimes even driving, the servants,
for few of the Gauchos, whether male or female, could
work with speed enough to please old Jenny.</p>
<p>Well, the sheds had to be cleared out, and a system of
corralling adopted which was only called for during times
like these. Then there were the weighing machines to be
seen to; the tally tables and all the packing and pressing
machinery&mdash;which on this large <i>estancia</i> was carried
almost to perfection&mdash;had all to be got into the very best
working order imaginable. For, in the matter of sheep-shearing,
Moncrieff was fastidious to a degree.</p>
<p>The sheep were washed the day before. This was hard
work, for no animal I know of is more obstinate than a
sheep when it makes up its mind to be so.</p>
<p>So the work commenced, and day after day it went
merrily on. Moncrieff did not consider this a very large
shearing, and yet in six days' time no less than 11,000
sheep were turned away fleeceless.</p>
<p>And what a scene it was, to be sure!</p>
<p>I remember well, when quite a little lad, thinking old
Parson McGruer's shearing a wonderful sight. The old
man, who was very fat and podgy, and seldom got down to
breakfast before eleven in the morning, considered himself
a sheep farmer on rather a large scale. Did he not own a
flock of nearly six hundred&mdash;one shepherd's work&mdash;that
fed quietly on the heath-clad braes of Coila? One
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
shepherd and two collies; and the collies did nearly all
the duty in summer and a great part of it in winter. The
shepherd had his bit of shieling in a clump of birch-trees
at the glen-foot, and at times, crook in hand, his Highland
plaid dangling from his shoulder, he might be seen slowly
winding along the braes, or standing, statue-like, on the
hill-top, his romantic figure well defined against the
horizon, and very much in keeping with the scene. I
never yet saw the minister's shepherd running. His life
was almost an idyllic one in summer, when the birks
waved green and eke, or in autumn, when the hills were
all ablaze with the crimson glory of the heather. To be
sure, his pay was not a great deal, and his fare for the
most part consisted of oatmeal and milk, with now and
then a slice of the best part of a 'braxied' sheep. Here,
in our home in the Silver West, how different! Every
<i>puestero</i> had a house or hut as good as the minister's
shepherd; and as for living, why, the worthy Mr.
McGruer himself never had half so well-found a table.
Our dogs in the Silver West lived far more luxuriously than
any farm servant or shepherd, or even gamekeeper, 'in a'
braid Scotland.'</p>
<p>But our shepherds had to run and to ride both.
Wandering over miles upon miles of pasturage, sheep
learn to be dainty, and do not stay very long in any one
place; so it is considered almost impossible to herd them on
foot. It is not necessary to do so; at all events, where one
can buy a horse for forty shillings, and where his food costs
<i>nil</i>, or next to <i>nil</i>, one usually prefers riding to walking.</p>
<p>But it was a busy time in May even at the Scotch
minister's place when sheep-shearing came round. The
minister got up early then, if he did not do so all the year
round again. The hurdles were all taken to the river-side,
or banks of the stream that, leaving Loch Coila,
went meandering through the glen. Here the sheep were
washed and penned, and anon turned into the enclosures
where the shearers were. Lads and lasses all took part
in the work in one capacity or another. The sun would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
be brightly shining, the 'jouking burnie' sparkling clear
in its rays; the glens and hills all green and bonnie; the
laughing and joking and lilting and singing, and the
constant bleating of sheep and lambs, made altogether a
curious medley; but every now and then Donald the
piper would tune his pipes and make them 'skirl,'
drowning all other sounds in martial melody.</p>
<p>But here on Moncrieff's <i>estancia</i> everything was on a
grander scale. There was the same bleating of sheep, the
same laughing, joking, lilting, singing, and piping; the
same hurry-scurry of dogs and men; the same prevailing
busy-ness and activity; but everything was multiplied by
twenty.</p>
<p>McGruer at home in Coila had his fleeces thrust into a
huge sack, which was held up by two stalwart Highlanders.
Into this not only were the fleeces put, but also a boy, to
jump on them and pack them down. At the <i>estancia</i> we
had the very newest forms of machinery to do everything.</p>
<p>Day by day, as our shearing went on, Moncrieff grew
gayer and gayer, and on the final morning he was as full
of life and fun as a Harrow schoolboy out on the range.
The wool harvest had turned out well.</p>
<p>It had not been so every year with Moncrieff and his
partner. They had had many struggles to come through&mdash;sickness
had at one time more than decimated the
flocks. The Indians, though they do not as a rule drive
away sheep, had played sad havoc among them, and
scattered them far and wide over the adjoining pampas,
and the pampero<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> had several times destroyed its thousands,
before the trees had grown up to afford protection and
shelter.</p>
<p>I have said before that Moncrieff was fond of doing
things in his own fashion. He was willing enough to
adopt all the customs of his adopted country so long as he
thought they were right, but many of the habits of his
native land he considered would engraft well with those
of Mendoza. Moncrieff delighted in dancing&mdash;that is, in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
giving a good hearty rout, and he simply did so whenever
there was the slightest excuse. The cereal harvest ended
thus, the grape harvest also, and making of the wine and
preserves, and so of course did the shearing.</p>
<p>The dinner at the mansion itself was a great success;
the supper in the marquee, with the romp to follow, was even
a greater. Moncrieff himself opened the fun with Aunt
Cecilia as a partner, Donald and a charming Spanish girl
completing the quartette necessary for a real Highland
reel. The piper played, of course (guitars were not good
enough for this sort of thing), and I think we must have
kept that first 'hoolichin' up for nearly twenty minutes.
Then Moncrieff and aunt were fain to retire 'for-fochten.'<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
<p>Well Moncrieff might have been 'for-fochten,' but
neither Donald nor his Spanish lassie were half tired.
Nor was the piper.</p>
<p>'Come on, Dugald,' cried Donald, 'get a partner, lad.
Hooch!'</p>
<p>'Hooch!' shouted Dugald in response, and lo and
behold! he gaily led forth&mdash;whom? Why, whom but old
Jenny herself? What roars of laughter there was as,
keeping time to a heart-stirring strathspey, the litle lady
cracked her thumbs and danced, reeling, setting, and
deeking! roars of laughter, and genuine hearty applause
as well.</p>
<p>Moncrieff was delighted with his mother's performance.
It was glorious, he said, and so true to time; surely
everybody would believe him now that mither was a
downright ma<i>r-r-r-</i>vel. And everybody did.</p>
<p>During the shearing Donald and I had done duty as
clerks; and very busy we had been kept. As for Dugald,
it would have been a pity to have parted him and his dear
gun, so the work assigned to him was that of lion's
provider&mdash;we, the shearing folk, being the lion.</p>
<p>For a youth of hardly sixteen Dugald was a splendid
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
shot, and during the shearing he really kept up his credit
well. Moncrieff objected to have birds killed when
breeding; but in this country, as indeed in any other
where game is numerous, there are hosts of birds that do
not, for various reasons, breed or mate every season.
These generally are to be found either singly and
solitary, as if they had some great grief on their minds
that they desired to nurse in solitude, or in small flocks of
gay young bachelors. Dugald knew such birds well, and
it was from the ranks of these he always filled the
larder.</p>
<p>To the supply thus brought daily by Dugald were
added fowls, ducks, and turkeys from the <i>estancia's</i>
poultry-yard, to say nothing of joints of beef, mutton, and
pork. Nor was it birds alone that Dugald's seemingly
inexhaustible creels and bags were laden with, but eggs
of the swan<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and the wild-duck and goose, with&mdash;to serve
as tit-bits for those who cared for such desert delicacies&mdash;cavies,
biscachas, and now and then an armadillo. If these
were not properly appreciated by the new settlers, the
eyes of the old, and especially the Gauchos, sparkled with
anticipation of gustatory delight on beholding them.</p>
<p>For some days after the shearing was over comparative
peace reigned around and over the great <i>estancia</i>. But
nevertheless preparations were being made to send off a
string of waggons to Villa Mercedes. The market at
Mendoza was hardly large enough to suit Moncrieff, nor
were the prices so good as could be obtained in the east.
Indeed, Moncrieff had purchasing agents from Villa
Mercedes to meet his waggons on receipt of a telegram.</p>
<p>So the waggons were loaded up&mdash;wool, wine, and
preserves, as well as raisins.</p>
<p>To describe the vineyards at our <i>estancia</i> would take
up far too much space. I must leave them to the
reader's imagination; but I hardly think I am wrong
in stating that there are no grapes in the world more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
delicious or more viniferous than those that grow in the
province of Mendoza. The usual difficulty is not in the
making of wine, but in the supply of barrels and bottles.
Moncrieff found a way out of this; and in some hotels in
Buenos Ayres, and even Monte Video, the Château
Moncrieff had already gained some celebrity.</p>
<p>The manufacture of many different kinds of preserves
was quite an industry at the <i>estancia</i>, and one that paid
fairly well. There were orangeries as well as vineries;
and although the making of marmalade had not before
been attempted, Moncrieff meant now to go in for it on
quite a large scale. This branch was to be superintended
by old Jenny herself, and great was her delight to find
out that she was of some use on the estate, for 'really
'oman,' she told aunt, 'a body gets tired of the stockin'&mdash;shank,
shank, shank a' day is hard upon the hands,
though a body maun do something.'</p>
<p>Well, the waggons were laden and off at last. With
them went Moncrieff's Welsh partner as commander, to
see to the sale, and prevent the Gauchos and drivers
generally from tapping the casks by the way. The force
of men, who were all well armed, was quite sufficient to
give an excellent account of any number of prowling
Indians who were likely to put in an appearance.</p>
<p>And now summer, in all its glory, was with us. And
such glory! Such glory of vegetable life, such profusion
of foliage, such wealth of colouring, such splendour of
flowers! Such glory of animal life, beast and bird and
insect! The flowers themselves were not more gay and
gorgeous than some of these latter.</p>
<p>Nor were we very greatly plagued with the hopping and
blood-sucking genera. Numerous enough they were at
times, it must be confessed, both by day and night; but
somehow we got used to them. The summer was wearing
to a close, the first wing of our Coila Villa was finished
and dry, the furniture was put in, and as soon as the smell
of paint left we took possession.</p>
<p>This was made the occasion for another of Moncrieff's
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
festive gatherings. Neighbours came from all directions
except the south, for we knew of none in this direction
besides the wild Pampean Indians, and they were not
included in the invitation. Probably we should make them
dance some other day.</p>
<p>About a fortnight after our opening gathering, or
'house-warming,' as Moncrieff called it, we had a spell of
terribly hot weather. The heat was of a sultry, close
description, difficult to describe: the cattle, sheep, and
horses seemed to suffer very much, and even the poor dogs.
These last, by the way, we found it a good plan to clip.
Long coats did not suit the summer season.</p>
<p>One evening it seemed hotter and sultrier than ever.
We were all seated out in the verandah, men-folk
smoking, and aunt and Aileen fanning themselves and
fighting the insects, when suddenly a low and ominous
rumbling was heard which made us all start except
Moncrieff.</p>
<p>Is it thunder? No; there is not at present a cloud in
the sky, although a strange dark haze is gathering over
the peaks on the western horizon.</p>
<p>'Look!' said Moncrieff to me. As he spoke he pointed
groundwards. Beetles and ants and crawling insects of
every description were heading for the verandah, seeking
shelter from the coming storm.</p>
<p>The strange rumbling grew louder!</p>
<p>It was not coming from the sky, but from the earth!

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>THE EARTHQUAKE.</h3>
</div>

<p>With a rapidity that was truly alarming the black haze
in the west crept upwards over the sky, the sun was
engulfed in a few minutes, and before half an hour,
accompanied by a roaring wind and a whirl of dust and
decayed leaves, the storm was with us and on us, the whole
<i>estancia</i> being enveloped in clouds and darkness.</p>
<p>The awful earth sounds still continued&mdash;increased, in fact&mdash;much
to the terror of every one of us. We had retreated
to the back sitting-room. Moncrieff had left us for a time,
to see to the safety of the cattle and the farm generally,
for the Gauchos were almost paralyzed with fear, and it
was found afterwards that the very shepherds had left
their flocks and fled for safety&mdash;if safety it could be called&mdash;to
their <i>puestos</i>.</p>
<p>Yet Gauchos are not as a rule afraid of storms, but&mdash;and
it is somewhat remarkable&mdash;an old Indian seer had for
months before been predicting that on this very day and
night the city of Mendoza would be destroyed by an
earthquake, and that not only the town but every village
in the province would be laid low at the same time.</p>
<p>It is difficult to give the reader any idea of the events of
this dreadful night. I can only briefly relate my own
feelings and experiences. As we all sat there, suddenly
a great river of blood appeared to split the dark heavens in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
two, from zenith to horizon. It hung in the sky for long
seconds, and was followed by a peal of thunder of terrific
violence, accompanied by sounds as if the whole building
and every building on the estate were being rent and riven
in pieces. At the self-same moment a strange, dizzy, sleepy
feeling rushed through my brain. I could only see those
around me as if enshrouded in a blue-white mist. I tried
to rise from my chair, but fell back, not as I thought into
a chair but into a boat. Floor and roof and walls appeared
to meet and clasp. My head swam. I was not only dizzy
but deaf apparently, not too deaf, however, to hear the wild,
unearthly, frightened screams of twenty at least of our
Gaucho servants, who were huddled together in the centre
of the garden. It was all over in a few seconds: even the
thunder was hushed and the wind no longer bent the poplars
or roared through the cloud-like elm-trees. A silence that
could be felt succeeded, broken only by the low moan of
terror that the Gauchos kept up; a silence that soon
checked even that sound itself; a silence that crept round the
heart, and held us all spellbound; a silence that was ended
at last by terrible thunderings and lightnings and earth-tremblings,
with all the same dizzy, sleepy, sickening
sensations that had accompanied the first shock. I felt as
if chaos had come again, and for a time felt also as if death
itself would have been a relief.</p>
<p>But this shock passed next, and once more there was a
solemn silence, a drear stillness. And now fear took
possession of every one of us, and a desire to flee away
somewhere&mdash;anywhere. This had almost amounted to
panic, when Moncrieff himself appeared in the verandah.</p>
<p>'I've got our fellows to put up the marquee,' he said,
almost in a whisper. 'Come&mdash;we'll be safer there.
Mither, I'll carry you. You're not afraid, are you?'</p>
<p>'Is the worruld comin' tae an end?' asked old Jenny,
looking dazed as her son picked her up. 'Is the worruld
comin' tae an end, <i>and the marmalade no made yet</i>?'</p>
<p>In about an hour after this the storm was at its worst.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Flash followed flash, peal followed peal: the world seemed
in flames, the hills appeared to be falling on us. The rain
and hailstones came down in vast sheets, and with a noise
so great that even the thunder itself was heard but as a
subdued roar.</p>
<p>We had no light here&mdash;we needed none. The lightning,
or the reflection of it, ran in under the canvas on the
surface of the water, which must have been inches deep.
The hail melted as soon as it fell, and finally gave place to
rain alone; then the water that flowed through the tent
felt warm, if not hot, to the touch. This was no doubt
occasioned by the force with which it fell to the ground.
The falling rain now looked like cords of gold and silver,
so brightly was it illuminated by the lightning.</p>
<p>While the storm was still at its height suddenly there
was a shout from one of the Gauchos.</p>
<p>'Run, run! the tent is falling!' was the cry.</p>
<p>It was only too true. A glance upwards told us this.
We got into the open air just in time, before, weighted
down by tons of water, the great marquee came groundwards
with a crash.</p>
<p>But though the rain still came down in torrents and the
thunder roared and rattled over and around us, no further
shock of earthquake was felt. Fear fled then, and we
made a rush for the house once more. Moncrieff reached
the casement window first, with a Gaucho carrying a
huge lantern. This man entered, but staggered out again
immediately.</p>
<p>'The ants! the ants!' he shouted in terror.</p>
<p>Moncrieff had one glance into the room, as if to satisfy
himself. I took the lantern from the trembling hands of
the Gaucho and held it up, and the sight that met my
astonished gaze was one I shall never forget. The whole
room was in possession of myriads of black ants of
enormous size; they covered everything&mdash;walls, furniture,
and floor&mdash;with one dense and awful pall.</p>
<p>The room looked strange and mysterious in its living,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
moving covering. Here was indeed the blackness of
darkness. Yes, and it was a darkness too that could be
felt. Of this I had a speedy proof of a most disagreeable
nature. I was glad to hand the lantern back and seek for
safety in the rain again.</p>
<p>Luckily the sitting-room door was shut, and this was the
only room not taken possession of.</p>
<p>After lights had been lit in the drawing-room the storm
did not appear quite so terrible; but no one thought of
retiring that night. The vague fear that something more
dreadful still might occur kept hanging in our minds, and
was only dispelled when daylight began to stream in at the
windows.</p>
<p>By breakfast-time there was no sign in the blue sky that
so fearful a storm had recently raged there. Nor had any
very great violence been done about the farmyards by the
earthquake.</p>
<p>Many of the cattle that had sought shelter beneath the
trees had been killed, however; and in one spot we found
the mangled remains of over one hundred sheep. Here
also a huge chestnut-tree had been struck and completely
destroyed, pieces of the trunk weighing hundreds of
pounds being scattered in every direction over the field.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are of common occurrence in the province
of Mendoza, but seldom are they accompanied by such
thunder, lightning, and rain as we had on this occasion.
It was this demonstration, coupled with the warning words
of the Indian seer, which had caused the panic among our
worthy Gaucho servants. But the seer had been a false
prophet for once, and as the Gauchos seized him on this
same day and half drowned him in the lake, there was but
little likelihood that he would prophesy the destruction of
Mendoza again.</p>
<p>Mendoza had been almost totally destroyed already by
an awful earthquake that occurred in 1861. Out of a
population of nearly sixteen thousand souls no less than
thirteen thousand, we are told, were killed&mdash;swallowed up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
by the yawning earth. Fire broke out afterwards, and, as
if to increase the wretchedness and sad condition of the
survivors, robbers from all directions&mdash;even from beyond
the Andes&mdash;flocked to the place to loot and pillage it.
But Mendoza is now built almost on the ashes of the
destroyed city, and its population must be equal to, even
if it does not exceed, its former aggregate.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>With the exception of a few losses, trifling enough to
one in Moncrieff's position, the whole year was a singularly
successful one. Nor had my brothers nor I and the other
settlers any occasion to complain, and our prospects began
to be very bright indeed.</p>
<p>Nor did the future belie the present, for ere another
year had rolled over our heads we found ourselves in a
fair way to fortune. We felt by this time that we were
indeed old residents. We were thoroughly acclimatized:
healthy, hardy, and brown. In age we were, some would
say, mere lads; in experience we were already men.</p>
<p>Our letters from home continued to be of the most
cheering description, with the exception of Townley's to
aunt. He had made little if any progress in his quest.
Not that he despaired. Duncan M'Rae was still absent,
but sooner or later&mdash;so Townley believed&mdash;poverty would
bring him to bay, and <i>then</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>Nothing of this did my aunt tell me at the time. I
remained in blissful ignorance of anything and everything
that our old tutor had done or was doing.</p>
<p>True, the events of that unfortunate evening at the old
ruin sometimes arose in my mind to haunt me. My
greatest sorrow was my being bound down by oath to keep
what seemed to me the secret of a villain&mdash;a secret that
had deprived our family of the estates of Coila, had
deprived my parents&mdash;yes, that was the hard and painful
part. For, strange as it may appear, I cared nothing for
myself. So enamoured had I become of our new home in
the Silver West, that I felt but little longing to return to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
the comparative bleakness and desolation of even Scottish
Highland scenery. I must not be considered unpatriotic
on this account, or if there was a decay of patriotism in
my heart, the fascinating climate of Mendoza was to blame
for it. I could not help feeling at times that I had eaten
the lotus-leaf. Had we not everything that the heart of
young men could desire? On my own account, therefore,
I felt no desire to turn the good soldier M'Rae away from
Coila, and as for Irene&mdash;as for bringing a tear to the eyes
of that beautiful and engaging girl, I would rather, I
thought, that the dark waters of the laguna should close
over my head for ever.</p>
<p>Besides, dear father was happy. His letters told me
that. He had even come to like his city life, and he
never wrote a word about Coila.</p>
<p>Still, the oath&mdash;the oath that bound me! It was a
dark spot in my existence.</p>
<p><i>Did</i> it bind me? I remember thinking that question
over one day. Could an oath forced upon any one be
binding in the sight of Heaven? I ran off to consult my
brother Moncrieff. I found him riding his great bay mare,
an especial favourite, along the banks of the highest
<i>estancia</i> canal&mdash;the canal that fed the whole system of
irrigation. Here I joined him, myself on my pet brown
mule.</p>
<p>'Planning more improvements, Moncrieff?' I asked.</p>
<p>He did not speak for a minute or two.</p>
<p>'I'm not planning improvements,' he said at last, 'but
I was just thinking it would be well, in our orra<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> moments,
if we were to strengthen this embankment. There is a
terrible power o' water here. Now supposing that during
some awful storm, with maybe a bit shock of earthquake,
it were to burst here or hereabouts, don't you see that the
flood would pour right down upon the mansion-house, and
clean it almost from its foundations?'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>'I trust,' I said, 'so great a catastrophe will not occur
in our day.'</p>
<p>'It would be a fearful accident, and a judgment maybe
on my want of forethought.'</p>
<p>'I want to ask you a question,' I said, 'on another
subject, Moncrieff.'</p>
<p>'You're lookin' scared, laddie. What's the matter?'</p>
<p>I told him as much as I could.</p>
<p>'It's a queer question, laddie&mdash;a queer question. Heaven
give me help to answer you! I think, as the oath was to
keep a secret, you had best keep the oath, and trust to
Heaven to set things right in the end, if it be for the best.'</p>
<p>'Thanks, Moncrieff,' I said; 'thanks. I will take your
advice.'</p>
<p>That very day Moncrieff set a party of men to strengthen
the embankment; and it was probably well he did so, for
soon after the work was finished another of those fearful
storms, accompanied as usual by shocks of earthquake,
swept over our valley, and the canal was filled to overflowing,
but gave no signs of bursting. Moncrieff had
assuredly taken time by the forelock.</p>
<p>One day a letter arrived, addressed to me, which bore
the London post-mark.</p>
<p>It was from Archie, and a most spirited epistle it was.
He wanted us to rejoice with him, and, better still, to
expect him out by the very first packet. His parents had
yielded to his request. It had been the voyage to
Newcastle that had turned the scale. There was nothing
like pluck, he said; 'But,' he added, 'between you and me,
Murdoch, I would not take another voyage in a Newcastle
collier, not to win all the honour and glory of Livingstone,
Stanley, Gordon-Cumming, and Colonel Frederick Burnaby
put in a bushel basket.'</p>
<p>I went tearing away over the <i>estancia</i> on my mule, to
find my brothers and tell them the joyful tidings. And
we rejoiced together. Then I went off to look for
Moncrieff, and he rejoiced, to keep me company.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></p>
<p>'And mind you,' he said, 'the very day after he arrives
we'll have a dinner and a kick-up.'</p>
<p>'Of course we will,' I said. 'We'll have the dinner and
fun at Coila Villa, which, remember, can now boast of two
wings besides the tower.'</p>
<p>'Very well,' he assented, 'and after that we can give
another dinner and rout at my diggings. Just a sort of
return match, you see?'</p>
<p>'But I don't see,' I said; 'I don't see the use of two
parties.'</p>
<p>'Oh, but I do, Murdoch. We must make more of a
man than we do of a nowt<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> beast. Now you mind that
bull I had sent out from England&mdash;Towsy Jock that lives
in the Easter field?&mdash;well, I gave a dinner when he came.
£250 I paid for him too.'</p>
<p>'Yes, and I remember also you gave a dinner and fun
when the prize ram came out. Oh, catch you not finding
an excuse for a dinner! However, so be it: one dinner
and fun for a bull, two for Archie.'</p>
<p>'That's agreed then,' said Moncrieff.</p>
<p>Now, my brothers and I and a party of Gauchos, with
the warlike Bombazo and a Scot or two, had arranged a
grand hunt into the guanaco country; but as dear old
Archie was coming out so soon we agreed to postpone it,
in order that he might join in the fun. Meanwhile we
commenced to make all preparations.</p>
<p>They say that the principal joy in life lies in the anticipation
of pleasure to come. I think there is a considerable
amount of truth in this, and I am sure that not even bluff
old King Hal setting out to hunt in the New Forest could
have promised himself a greater treat than we did as we
got ready for our tour in the land of the guanaco, and
country of the condor.</p>
<p>We determined to be quite prepared to start by the
time Archie was due. Not that we meant to hurry our
dear cockney cousin right away to the wilds as soon as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
arrived. No; we would give him a whole week to 'shake
down,' as Moncrieff called it, and study life on the <i>estancia</i>.</p>
<p>And, indeed, life on the <i>estancia</i>, now that we had become
thoroughly used to it, was exceedingly pleasant altogether.</p>
<p>I cannot say that either my brothers or I were ever
much given to lazing in bed of a morning in Scotland
itself. To have done so we should have looked upon as
bad form; but to encourage ourselves in matutinal sloth
in a climate like this would have seemed a positive crime.</p>
<p>Even by seven in the morning we used to hear the great
gong roaring hoarsely on Moncrieff's lawn, and this used
to be the signal for us to start and draw aside our mosquito
curtains. Our bedrooms adjoined, and all the time we
were splashing in our tubs and dressing we kept up an
incessant fire of banter and fun. The fact is, we used to
feel in such glorious form after a night's rest. Our bedroom
windows were very large casements, and were kept
wide open all the year round, so that virtually we slept in
the open air. We nearly always went to bed in the dark,
or if we did have lights we had to shut the windows till we
had put them out, else moths as big as one's hand, and all
kinds and conditions of insect life, would have entered
and speedily extinguished our candles. Even had the
windows been protected by glass, this insect life would have
been troublesome. In the drawing and dining rooms we
had specially prepared blinds of wire to exclude these
creatures, while admitting air enough.</p>
<p>The mosquito curtains round our beds effectually kept
everything disagreeable at bay, and insured us wholesome
rest.</p>
<p>But often we were out of bed and galloping over the
country long before the gong sounded. This ride used to
give us such appetites for breakfast, that sometimes we had
to apologize to aunt and Aileen for our apparent greediness.
We were out of doors nearly all day, and just as
often as not had a snack of luncheon on the hills at some
settler's house or at an outlying <i>puesto</i>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>Aunt was now our housekeeper, but nevertheless so
accustomed had we and Moncrieff and Aileen become to
each other's society that hardly a day passed without our
dining together either at his house or ours.</p>
<p>The day, what with one thing and another, used to pass
quickly enough, and the evening was most enjoyable,
despite even the worry of flying and creeping insects.
After dinner my brothers and I, with at times Moncrieff
and Bombazo, used to lounge round to see what the
servants were doing.</p>
<p>They had a concert, and as often as not some fun, every
night with the exception of Sabbath, when Moncrieff
insisted that they should retire early.</p>
<p>At many <i>estancias</i> wine is far too much in use&mdash;even
to the extent of inebriety. Our places, however, owing
to Moncrieff's strictness, were models of temperance,
combined with innocent pleasures. The master, as he was
called, encouraged all kinds of games, though he objected
to gambling, and drinking he would not permit at any
price.</p>
<p>One morning our post-runner came to Coila Villa in
greater haste than usual, and from his beaming eyes and
merry face I conjectured he had a letter for me.</p>
<p>I took it from him in the verandah, and sent him off
round to the kitchen to refresh himself. No sooner had I
glanced at its opening sentences than I rushed shouting
into the breakfast-room.</p>
<p>'Hurrah!' I cried, waving the letter aloft. 'Archie's
coming, and he'll be here to-day. Hurrah! for the hunt,
lads, and hurrah! for the hills!'

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>OUR HUNTING EXPEDITION.</h3>
</div>

<p>If not quite so exuberant as the welcome that awaited
us on our arrival in the valley, Archie's was a right
hearty one, and assuredly left our cousin nothing to
complain of.</p>
<p>He had come by diligence from Villa Mercedes,
accomplishing the journey, therefore, in a few days,
which had occupied us in our caravan about as many
weeks.</p>
<p>We were delighted to see him looking so well. Why,
he had even already commenced to get brown, and was
altogether hardy and hearty and manlike.</p>
<p>We were old <i>estancieros</i>, however, and it gave us
unalloyed delight to show him round our place and put
him up to all the outs and ins of a settler's life.</p>
<p>Dugald even took him away to the hills with him, and
the two of them did not get home until dinner was on the
table.</p>
<p>Archie, however, although not without plenty of pluck
and willingness to develop into an <i>estanciero</i> pure and
simple, had not the stamina my brothers and I possessed,
but this only made us all the more kind to him. In time,
we told him, he would be quite as strong and wiry as any
of us.</p>
<p>'There is one thing I don't think I shall ever be able to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
get over,' said Archie one day. It may be observed that
he did not now talk with the London drawl; he had left
both his cockney tongue and his tall hat at home.</p>
<p>'What is it you do not think you will ever get over,
Arch?' I asked.</p>
<p>'Why, the abominable creepies,' he answered, looking
almost miserable.</p>
<p>'Why,' he continued, 'it isn't so much that I mind
being bitten by mosquitoes&mdash;of which it seems you have
brutes that fly by day, and gangs that go on regular duty at
night&mdash;but it is the other abominations that make my
blood run positively cold. Now your cockroaches are all
very well down in the coal-cellar, and centipedes are interesting
creatures in glass cases with pins stuck through
them; but to find cockroaches in your boots and centipedes
in your bed is rather too much of a good thing.'</p>
<p>'Well,' said Dugald, laughing, 'you'll get used to even
that. I don't really mind now what bites me or what
crawls over me. Besides, you know all those creepie-creepies,
as you call them, afford one so excellent an
opportunity of studying natural history from the life.'</p>
<p>'Oh, bother such life, Dugald! My dear cousin, I would
rather remain in blissful ignorance of natural history all
my life than have even an earwig reposing under my
pillow.  Besides, I notice that even your Yahoo
servants&mdash;'</p>
<p>'I beg your pardon, cousin; Gaucho, not Yahoo.'</p>
<p>'Well, well, Gaucho servants shudder, and even run from
our common bedroom creepies.'</p>
<p>'Oh! they are nothing at all to go by, Archie. They
think because a thing is not very pretty it is bound to be
venomous.'</p>
<p>'But does not the bite of a centipede mean death?'</p>
<p>'Oh dear no. It isn't half as bad as London vermin.'</p>
<p>'Then there are scorpions. Do they kill you? Is not
their bite highly dangerous?'</p>
<p>'Not so bad as a bee's sting.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>'Then there are so many flying beetles.'</p>
<p>'Beauties, Archie, beauties. Why, Solomon in all his
glory was not arrayed like some of these.'</p>
<p>'Perhaps not. But then, Solomon or not Solomon, how
am I to know which sting and which don't?'</p>
<p>'<i>Experientia docet</i>, Archie.'</p>
<p>Archie shuddered.</p>
<p>'Again, there are spiders. Oh, they do frighten me.
They're as big as lobsters. Ugh!'</p>
<p>'Well, they won't hurt. They help to catch the other
things!'</p>
<p>'Yes, and that's just the worst of it. First a lot of
creepies come in to suck your blood and inject poison into
your veins, to say nothing of half scaring a fellow to death;
and then a whole lot of flying creepies, much worse than
the former, come in to hunt them up; and bats come next,
to say nothing of lizards; and what with the buzzing and
singing and hopping and flapping and beating and thumping,
poor <i>me</i> has to lie awake half the night, falling asleep
towards morning to dream I'm in purgatory.'</p>
<p>'Poor <i>you</i> indeed!' said Dugald.</p>
<p>'You have told me, too, I must sleep in the dark, but I
want to know what is the good of that when about one
half of those flying creepies carry a lamp each, and some of
them two. Only the night before last I awoke in a fright.
I had been dreaming about the great sea-serpent, and the
first thing I saw was a huge creature about as long as a
yard stick wriggling along my mosquito curtains.'</p>
<p>'Ah! How could you see it in the dark?'</p>
<p>'Why, the beggar carried two lamps ahead of him, and
he had a smaller chap with a light. Ugh!'</p>
<p>'These were some good specimens of the <i>Lampyridæ</i>, no
doubt.'</p>
<p>'Well, perhaps; but having such a nice long name
doesn't make them a bit less hideous to me. Then in the
morning when I looked into the glass I didn't know myself
from Adam. I had a black eye that some bug or other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
had given me&mdash;I dare say he also had a nice long name. I
had a lump on my brow as large as a Spanish onion, and
my nose was swollen and as big as a bladder of lard.
From top to toe I was covered with hard knots, as if I'd
been to Donnybrook Fair, and what with aching and itching
it would have been a comfort to me to have jumped out of
my skin.'</p>
<p>'Was that all?' I said, laughing.</p>
<p>'Not quite. I went to take up a book to fling at a
monster spider in the corner, and put my hand on a
scorpion. I cracked him and crushed the spider, and went
to have my bath, only to find I had to fish out about twenty
long-named indescribables that had committed suicide
during the night. Other creepies had been drowned in
the ewer. I found earwigs in my towels, grasshoppers in
my clothes, and wicked-looking little beetles even in my
hairbrushes. This may be a land flowing with milk and
honey and all the rest of it, Murdoch, but it is also a land
crawling with creepie-creepies.'</p>
<p>'Well, anyhow,' said Dugald, 'here comes your mule.
Mount and have a ride, and we'll forget everything but
the pleasures of the chase. Come, I think I know where
there is a jaguar&mdash;an immense great brute. I saw him
killing geese not three days ago.'</p>
<p>'Oh, that will be grand!' cried Archie, now all
excitement.</p>
<p>And five minutes afterwards Dugald and he were off to
the hills.</p>
<p>But in two days more we would be off to the hills in
earnest.</p>
<p>For this tour we would not of our own free-will have
made half the preparations Moncrieff insisted on, and
perhaps would hardly have provided ourselves with tents.
However, we gave in to his arrangements in every way,
and certainly we had no cause to repent it.</p>
<p>The guide&mdash;he was to be called our <i>cacique</i> for the time
being&mdash;that Moncrieff appointed had been a Gaucho malo,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
a pampas Cain. No one ever knew half the crimes the
fellow had committed, and I suppose he himself had
forgotten. But he was a reformed man and really a
Christian, and it is difficult to find such an anomaly among
Gauchos. He knew the pampas well, and the Andes too,
and was far more at home in the wilds than at the <i>estancia</i>.
A man like this, Moncrieff told us, was worth ten times
his weight in gold.</p>
<p>And so it turned out.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The summer had well-nigh gone when our caravan at
length left Moncrieff's beautiful valley. The words 'caravan
at length' in the last sentence may be understood in two
ways, either as regards space or time. Ours was no caravan
on wheels. Not a single wheeled waggon accompanied us,
for we should cross deserts, and pass through glens where
there would be no road, perhaps hardly even a bridle-path.
So the word caravan is to be understood in the Arab sense
of the word. And it certainly was a lengthy one. For we
had a pack mule for every two men, including our five
Gauchos.</p>
<p>Putting it in another way, there were five of us
Europeans&mdash;Donald, Dugald, Archie Bateman, Sandie
Donaldson, and myself; each European had a horse and a
Gaucho servant, and each Gaucho had a mule.</p>
<p>Bombazo meant to have come; he said so to the very last,
at all events, but an unfortunate attack of toothache
confined him to bed. Archie, who had no very exalted idea
of the little Spanish captain's courage, was rude enough to
tell us in his hearing that he was 'foxing.' I do not pretend
to understand what Archie meant, but I feel certain it was
nothing very complimentary to Bombazo's bravery.</p>
<p>'Dear laddies,' old Jenny had said, 'if you think you
want onybody to darn your hose on the road, I'll gang wi'
ye mysel'. As for that feckless loon Bombazo, the peer<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
body is best in bed.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>Our arms consisted of rifles, shot-guns, the bolas, and
lasso. Each man carried a revolver as well, and we had
also abundance of fishing tackle. Our tents were only
three in all, but they were strong and waterproof, a great
consideration when traversing a country like this.</p>
<p>We were certainly prepared to rough it, but had the good
sense to take with us every contrivance which might add
to our comfort, so long as it was fairly portable.</p>
<p>Archie had one particular valise of his own that he
declared contained only a few nicknacks which no one
ought to travel without. He would not gratify us by even
a peep inside, however, so for a time we had to be content
with guessing what the nicknacks were. Archie got pretty
well chaffed about his Gladstone bag, as he called it.</p>
<p>'You surely haven't got the tall hat in it,' said
Dugald.</p>
<p>'Of course you haven't forgotten your nightcap,' said
Donald.</p>
<p>'Nor your slippers, Archie?' I added.</p>
<p>'And a dressing-gown would be indispensable in the
desert,' said Sandie Donaldson.</p>
<p>Archie only smiled to himself, but kept his secret.</p>
<p>What a lovely morning it was when we set out! So blue
was the sky, so green the fields of waving lucerne, so dense
the foliage and flowers and hedgerows and trees, it really
seemed that summer would last for many and many a
month to come.</p>
<p>We were all fresh and happy, and full of buoyant
anticipation of pleasures to come. Our very dogs went
scampering on ahead, barking for very joy. Of these we
had quite a pack&mdash;three pure Scotch collies, two huge
bloodhound-mastiffs, and at least half a dozen animals
belonging to our Gauchos, which really were nondescripts
but probably stood by greyhounds. These dogs were on
exceedingly good terms with themselves and with each
other&mdash;the collies jumping up to kiss the horses every
minute by way of encouragement, the mastiffs trotting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
steadily on ahead cheek-by-jowl, and the hounds everywhere&mdash;everywhere
at once, so it appeared.</p>
<p>Being all so fresh, we determined to make a thorough
long day's journey of it. So, as soon as we had left the glen
entirely and disappeared among the sand dunes, we let our
horses have their heads, the <i>capataz</i> Gaucho riding on
ahead on a splendid mule as strong as a stallion and as lithe
as a Scottish deerhound.</p>
<p>Not long before our start for the hunting grounds men
had arrived from the Chilian markets to purchase cattle.
The greatest dainty to my mind they had brought with
them was a quantity of <i>Yerba maté</i>, as it is called. It is
the dried leaves of a species of Patagonian ilex, which is
used in this country as tea, and very delightful and soothing
it is. This was to be our drink during all our tour. More
refreshing than tea, less exciting than wine, it not only
seems to calm the mind but to invigorate the body. Drunk
warm, with or without sugar, all feeling of tiredness passes
away, and one is disposed to look at the bright side of life,
and that alone.</p>
<p>We camped the first night on high ground nearly forty
miles from our own <i>estancia</i>. It was a long day's journey
in so rough a country, but we had a difficulty earlier in the
afternoon in finding water. Here, however, was a stream
as clear as crystal, that doubtless made its way from springs
in the <i>sierras</i> that lay to the west of us at no very great
distance. Behind these jagged hills the sun was slowly
setting when we erected our tents. The ground chosen was
at some little distance from the stream, and on the bare
gravel. The cacti that grew on two sides of us were of
gigantic height, and ribboned or edged with the most
beautiful flowers. Our horses and mules were hobbled and
led to the stream, then turned on to the grass which grew
green and plentiful all along its banks.</p>
<p>A fire was quickly built and our great stewpan put on.
We had already killed our dinner in the shape of a small
deer or fawn which had crossed our path on the plains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
lower down. With biscuits, of which we had a store, some
curry, roots, which the Gauchos had found, and a handful
or two of rice, we soon had a dinner ready, the very flavour
of which would have been enough to make a dying man eat.</p>
<p>The dogs sat around us and around the Gauchos as we
dined, and, it must be allowed, behaved in a most
mannerly way; only the collies and mastiffs kept together.
They must have felt their superiority to those mongrel
greyhounds, and desired to show it in as calm and dignified
a manner as possible.</p>
<p>After dinner sentries were set, one being mounted to
watch the horses and mules. We were in no great fear of
their stampeding, but we had promised Moncrieff to run as
little risk of any kind as possible on this journey, and
therefore commenced even on this our first night to be as
good as our word.</p>
<p>The best Gauchos had been chosen for us, and every one
of them could talk English after a fashion, especially our
bold but not handsome <i>capataz</i>, or <i>cacique</i> Yambo. About
an hour after dinner the latter began serving out the <i>maté</i>.
This put us all in excellent humour and the best of spirits.
As we felt therefore as happy as one could wish to be, we
were not surprised when the <i>capataz</i> proposed a little music.</p>
<p>'It is the pampas fashion, señor,' he said to me.</p>
<p>'Will you play and sing?' I said.</p>
<p>'Play and sing?' he replied, at once producing his
guitar, which lay in a bag not far off. '<i>Si</i>, señor, I will
play and sing for you. If you bid me, I will dance; every
day and night I shall cook for you; when de opportunity
come I will fight for you. I am your servant, your slave,
and delighted to be so.'</p>
<p>'Thank you, my <i>capataz</i>; I have no doubt you are a very
excellent fellow.'</p>
<p>'Oh, señor, do not flatter yourself too mooch, too very
mooch. It is not for the sake of you young señors I care,
but for the sake of the dear master.'</p>
<p>'Sing, <i>capataz</i>,' I said, 'and talk after.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>To our surprise, not one but three guitars were handed
out, and the songs and melodies were very delightful to
listen to.</p>
<p>Then our Sandie Donaldson, after handing his cup to be
replenished, sang, <i>Ye banks and braes</i> with much feeling
and in fine manly tenor. We all joined in each
second verse, while the guitars gave excellent accompaniment.
One song suggested another, and from singing to
conversational story-telling the transition was easy. To be
sure, neither my brothers nor I nor Archie had much to
tell, but some of the experiences of the Gauchos, and
especially those of our <i>capataz</i>, were thrilling in the
extreme, and we never doubted their truth.</p>
<p>But now it was time for bed, and we returned to the
tents and lit our lamps.</p>
<p>Our beds were the hard ground, with a rug and guanaco
robe, our saddles turned upside down making as good a
pillow as any one could wish.</p>
<p>We had now the satisfaction of knowing something
concerning the contents of that mysterious grip-sack of
Archie's. So judge of our surprise when this wonderful
London cousin of ours first produced a large jar of what he
called mosquito cream, and proceeded to smear his face and
hands with the odorous compound.</p>
<p>'This cream,' he said, 'I bought at Buenos Ayres, and
it is warranted to keep all pampas creepies away, or
anything with two wings or four, six legs or sixty. Have
a rub, Dugald?'</p>
<p>'Not I,' cried Dugald. 'Why, man, the smell is enough
to kill bees.'</p>
<p>Archie proceeded with his preparations. Before
enshrouding himself in his guanaco mantle he drew on a
huge waterproof canvas sack and fastened it tightly round
his chest. He next produced a hooped head-dress. I know
no other name for it.</p>
<p>'It is an invention of my own,' said Archie, proudly,
'and is, as you see, composed of hoops of wire&mdash;'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>'Like a lady's crinoline,' said Dugald.</p>
<p>'Well, yes, if you choose to call it so, and is covered with
mosquito muslin. This is how it goes on, and I'm sure it
will form a perfect protection.'</p>
<p>He then inserted his head into the wondrous muslin
bladder, and the appearance he now presented was comical
in the extreme. His body in a sack, his head in a white
muslin bag, nothing human-looking about him except his
arms, that, encased in huge leather gloves, dangled from
his shoulders like an immense pair of flippers.</p>
<p>We three brothers looked at him just for a moment, then
simultaneously exploded into a perfect roar of laughter.
Sandie Donaldson, who with the <i>capataz</i> occupied the next
tent, came rushing in, then all the Gauchos and even the
dogs. The latter bolted barking when they saw the
apparition, but the rest joined the laughing chorus.</p>
<p>And the more we looked at Archie the more we laughed,
till the very sand dunes near us must have been shaken to
their foundations by the manifestation of our mirth.</p>
<p>'Laugh away, boys,' said our cousin. 'Laugh and grow
fat. I don't care how I look, so long as my dress and my
cream keep the creepies away.'

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>IN THE WILDERNESS.</h3>
</div>

<p>Some days afterwards we found ourselves among the
mountains in a region whose rugged grandeur and
semi-desolation, whose rock-filled glens, tall, frowning precipices,
with the stillness that reigned everywhere around,
imparted to it a character approaching even to sublimity.</p>
<p>The <i>capataz</i> was still our guide, our foremost man in
everything; but close beside him rode our indefatigable
hunter, Dugald.</p>
<p>We had already seen pumas, and even the terrible
jaguar of the plains; we had killed more than one rhea&mdash;the
American ostrich&mdash;and deer in abundance. Moreover,
Dugald had secured about fifty skins of the most lovely
humming-birds, with many beetles, whose elytra, painted
and adorned by Nature, looked like radiant jewels. All
these little skins and beetles were destined to be sent
home to Flora. As yet, however, we had not come in
contact with the guanaco, although some had been seen
at a distance.</p>
<p>But to-day we were in the very country of the guanaco,
and pressing onwards and ever upwards, in the hopes of
soon being able to draw trigger on some of these strange
inhabitants of the wilderness.</p>
<p>Only this morning Dugald and I had been bantering
each other as to who should shoot the first.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>'I mean to send my first skin to Flora,' Dugald had said.</p>
<p>'And I my first skin to Irene,' I said.</p>
<p>On rounding the corner of a cliff we suddenly came in
sight of a whole herd of the creatures, but they were in
full retreat up the glen, while out against the sky stood in
bold relief a tall buck. It was the trumpet tones of his
voice ringing out plaintively but musically on the still
mountain air that had warned the herd of our approach.</p>
<p>Another long ride of nearly two hours. And now we
must have been many thousands of feet above the sea
level, or even the level of the distant plains.</p>
<p>It is long past midday, so we determine to halt, for
here, pure, bubbling from a dark green slippery rock, is a
spring of water as clear as crystal and deliciously cool.
What a treat for our horses and dogs! What a treat even
for ourselves!</p>
<p>I notice that Dugald seems extra tired. He has done
more riding to-day than any of us, and made many a long
<i>détour</i> in search of that guanaco which he has hitherto
failed to find.</p>
<p>A kind of brotherly rivalry takes possession of me, and
I cannot help wishing that the first guanaco would fall to
my rifle. The Gauchos are busy preparing the stew and
boiling water for the <i>maté</i>, so shouldering my rifle, and
carelessly singing to myself, I leave my companions and
commence sauntering higher up the glen. The hill gets
very steep, and I have almost to climb on my hands and
knees, starting sometimes in dread as a hideous snake
goes wriggling past me or raises head and body from
behind a stone, and hisses defiance and hate almost in
my face. But I reach the summit at last, and find
myself on the very edge of a precipice.</p>
<p>Oh, joy! On a little peak down beneath, and not a
hundred yards away, stands one of the noblest guanacos
I have ever seen. He has heard something, or scented
something, for he stands there as still as a statue, with
head and neck in the air sniffing the breeze.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>How my heart beats! How my hand trembles! I
cannot understand my anxiety. Were I face to face with
a lion or tiger I could hardly be more nervous. A
thousand thoughts seem to cross my mind with a rush,
but uppermost of all is the fear that, having fired, I
shall miss.</p>
<p>He whinnies his warning now: only a low and undecided
one. He is evidently puzzled; but the herd down in the
bottom of the cañon hear it, and every head is elevated.
I have judged the distance; I have drawn my bead. If
my heart would only keep still, and there were not such
a mist before my eyes! Bang! I have fired, and quickly
load again. Have I missed? Yes&mdash;no, no; hurrah!
hurrah! yonder he lies, stark and still, on the very rock
on which he stood&mdash;my first guanaco!</p>
<p>The startled herd move up the cañon. They must
have seen their leader drop.</p>
<p>I am still gazing after them, full of exultation, when a
hand is laid on my shoulder, and, lo! there stands Dugald
laughing.</p>
<p>'You sly old dog,' he says, 'to steal a march on your
poor little brother thus!'</p>
<p>For a moment I am startled, mystified.</p>
<p>'Dugald,' I say, 'did I really kill that guanaco?'</p>
<p>'No one else did.'</p>
<p>'And you've only just come&mdash;only just this second?
Well, I'm glad to hear it. It was after all a pure accident
my shooting the beast. I <i>did</i> hold the rifle his way. I
<i>did</i> draw the trigger&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Well, and the bullet did the rest, boy. Funny, you
always kill by the merest chance! Ah, Murdoch, you're
a better shot than I am, for all you won't allow it.'</p>
<p>Wandering still onwards and still upwards next day,
through lonely glens and deep ravines, through cañons the
sides of which were as perpendicular as walls, their flat
green or brown bottoms sometimes scattered with huge
boulders, casting shadows so dark in the sunlight that a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
man or horse disappeared in them as if the earth had
opened and swallowed him up, we came at length to a
dell, or strath, of such charming luxuriance that it looked
to us, amid all the barrenness of this dreary wilderness,
like an oasis dropped from the clouds, or some sweet green
glade where fairies might dwell.</p>
<p>I looked at my brother. The same thought must have
struck each of us, at the same moment&mdash;Why not make
this glen our <i>habitat</i> for a time?</p>
<p>'Oh!' cried Archie, 'this is a paradise!'</p>
<p>'Beautiful! lovely!' said Dugald. 'Suppose now&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Oh, I know what you are going to say,' cried Donald.</p>
<p>'And I second the motion,' said Sandie Donaldson.</p>
<p>'Well,' I exclaimed, 'seeing, Sandie, that no motion has
yet been made&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Here is the motion, then,' exclaimed Dugald, jumping
out of his saddle.</p>
<p>It was a motion we all followed at once; and as the day
was getting near its close, the Gauchos set about looking
for a bit of camping-ground at once. As far as comfort
was concerned, this might have been chosen almost
anywhere, but we wanted to be near to water. Now here
was the mystery: the glen was not three miles long altogether,
and nowhere more than a mile broad; all along the
bottom it was tolerably level and extremely well wooded
with quite a variety of different trees, among which pines,
elms, chestnuts, and stunted oak-trees were most abundant;
each side of the glen was bounded by rising hills or braes
covered with algorroba bushes and patches of charmingly-coloured
cacti, with many sorts of prickly shrubs, the very
names of which we could not tell. Curious to say, there
was very little undergrowth; and, although the trees were
close enough in some places to form a jungle, the grass
was green beneath. But at first we could find no water.
Leaving the others to rest by the edge of the miniature
forest, Dugald and I and Archie set out to explore, and
had not gone more than a hundred yards when we came
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
to a little lake. We bent down and tasted the water; it
was pure and sweet and cool.</p>
<p>'What a glorious find!' said Dugald. 'Why, this
place altogether was surely made for us.'</p>
<p>We hurried back to tell the news, and the horses and
mules were led to the lake, which was little more than
half an acre in extent. But not satisfied with drinking,
most of the dogs plunged in; and horses and mules
followed suit.</p>
<p>'Come,' cried Donald, 'that is a sort of motion I will
willingly second.' He commenced to undress as he spoke.
So did we all, and such splashing and dashing, and
laughing and shouting, the birds and beasts in this
romantic dale had surely never witnessed before.</p>
<p>Dugald was an excellent swimmer, and as bold and
headstrong in the water as on the land. He had left us
and set out to cross the lake. Suddenly we saw him
throw up his arms and shout for help, and we&mdash;Donald
and I&mdash;at once commenced swimming to his assistance.
He appeared, however, in no danger of sinking, and, to
our surprise, although heading our way all the time, he
was borne away from us one minute and brought near
us next.</p>
<p>When close enough a thrill of horror went through
me to hear poor Dugald cry in a feeble, pleading voice,</p>
<p>'Come no nearer, boys: I soon must sink. Save yourselves:
I'm in a whirlpool.'</p>
<p>It was too true, though almost too awful to be borne.
I do not know how Donald felt at that moment, but as
for myself I was almost paralyzed with terror.</p>
<p>'Back, back, for your lives!' shouted a voice behind us.</p>
<p>It was our Gaucho <i>capataz</i>. He was coming towards
us with powerful strokes, holding in one hand a lasso.
Instead of swimming on with us when he saw Dugald in
danger, he had gone ashore at once and brought the
longest thong.</p>
<p>We white men could have done nothing. We knew of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
nothing to do. We should have floated there and seen
our dear brother go down before our eyes, or swam
recklessly, madly on, only to sink with him.</p>
<p>Dugald, weak as he had become, sees the Gaucho will
make an attempt to save him, and tries to steady himself
to catch the end of the lasso that now flies in his direction.</p>
<p>But to our horror it falls short, and Dugald is borne
away again, the circles round which he is swept being
now narrower.</p>
<p>The Gaucho is nearer. He is perilously near. He will
save him or perish.</p>
<p>Again the lasso leaves his hand. Dugald had thrown
up his hands and almost leapt from the water. He is
sinking. Oh, good Gaucho! Oh, good <i>capataz</i>, surely
Heaven itself directed that aim, for the noose fell over
our brother's arms and tightened round the chest!</p>
<p>In a few minutes more we have laid his lifeless body
on the green bank.</p>
<p>Lifeless only for a time, however. Presently he
breathes, and we carry him away into the evening sunshine
and place him on the soft warm moss. He soon
speaks, but is very ill and weak; yet our thanks to God
for his preservation are very sincere. Surely there is a
Providence around one even in the wilderness!</p>
<p>We might have explored our glen this same evening,
perhaps we really ought to have done so, but the excitement
caused by Dugald's adventure put everything else
out of our heads.</p>
<p>In this high region, the nights were even cold enough
to make a position near the camp fire rather a thing to be
desired than otherwise. It was especially delightful, I
thought, on this particular evening to sit around the fire
and quietly talk. I reclined near Dugald, who had not
yet quite recovered. I made a bed for him with extra
rugs; and, as he coughed a good deal, I begged of him to
consider himself an invalid for one night at least; but no
sooner had he drunk his mug of <i>maté</i> than he sat up and
joined in the conversation, assuring us he felt as well as
ever he had in his life.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>It was a lovely evening. The sky was unclouded, the
stars shining out very clear, and looking very near, while
a round moon was rising slowly over the hill-peaks towards
the east, and the tall dark pine-trees were casting gloomy
shadows on the lake, near which, in an open glade, we were
encamped. I could not look at the dark waters without a
shudder, as I thought of the danger poor Dugald had so
narrowly escaped. I am not sure that the boy was not
always my mother's favourite, and I know he was Flora's.
How could I have written and told them of his fearful
end? The very idea made me creep nearer to him and
put my arm round his shoulder. I suppose he interpreted
my thoughts, for he patted my knee in his brotherly
fond old fashion.</p>
<p>Our Gaucho <i>capataz</i> was just telling a story, an
adventure of his own, in the lonely pampas. He looked
a strange and far from comely being, with his long,
straggling, elf-like locks of hair, his low, receding forehead,
his swarthy complexion, and high cheek bones. The
mark of a terrible spear wound across his face and nose
did not improve his looks.</p>
<p>'Yes, señors,' he was saying, 'that was a fearful moment
for me.' He threw back his poncho as he spoke, revealing
three ugly scars on his chest. 'You see these, señors?
It was that same tiger made the marks. It was a keepsake,
ha! ha! that I will take to de grave with me, if
any one should trouble to bury me. It was towards
evening, and we were journeying across the pampa. We
had come far that day, my Indians and me. We felt
tired&mdash;sometimes even Indians felt tired on de weary wide
pampa. De sun has been hot all day. We have been
chased far by de white settlers. Dey not love us. Ha!
ha! We have five score of de cattle with us. And we
have spilt blood, and left dead and wounded Indians
plenty on de pampa. Never mind, I swear revenge. Oh,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
I am a bad man den. Gaucho malo, mucho malo, Nandrin,
my brother <i>cacique</i>, hate me. I hate him. I wish him dead.
But de Indians love him all de same as me. By and by
de sun go down, down, down, and we raise de <i>toldo</i><a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> in de
cañon near a stream. Here grow many ombu-trees. The
young señors have not seen this great tree; it is de king
of the lonely pampa. Oh, so tall! Oh, so wide! so
spreading and shady! Two, three ombu-trees grow near;
but I have seen de great tiger sleep in one. My brother
<i>cacique</i> have seen him too. When de big moon rise, and
all is bright like de day, and no sound make itself heard
but de woo-hoo-woo of de pampa owl, I get quietly up
and go to de ombu-tree. I think myself much more
brave as my brother <i>cacique</i>. Ha! ha! he think himself
more brave as me. When I come near de ombu-trees I
shout. Ugh! de scream dat comes from de ombu-tree
make me shake and shiver. Den de terrible tiger spring
down; I will not run, I am too brave. I shoot. He not
fall. Next moment I am down&mdash;on my back I lie. One
big foot is on me; his blood pour over my face. He pull
me close and more close to him. Soon, ah, soon, I think
my brother <i>cacique</i> will be chief&mdash;I will be no more. De
tiger licks my arm&mdash;my cheek. How he growl and froth!
He is now going to eat me. But no! Ha! ha! my
brother <i>cacique</i> have also leave de camp to come to de
ombu-tree. De tiger see him. P'r'aps he suppose his
blood more sweet as mine. He leave poor me. Ha! ha!
he catch my brother <i>cacique</i> and carry him under de
shade of de ombu-tree. By and by I listen, and hear my
brother's bones go crash! crash! crash! De tiger is
enjoying his supper!'</p>
<p>'But, <i>capataz</i>,' I said, with a shudder, 'did you make
no attempt to save your brother chief?'</p>
<p>'Not much! You see, he all same as dead. Suppose
I den shoot, p'r'aps I kill him for true; 'sides, I bad
Gaucho den; not love anybody mooch. Next day I kill
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
dat tiger proper, and his skin make good ponchos. Ha!
ha!'</p>
<p>Many a time during the Gaucho's recital he had paused
and looked uneasily around him, for ever and anon the
woods re-echoed with strange cries. We white men had
not lived long enough in beast-haunted wildernesses to
distinguish what those sounds were, whether they proceeded
from bird or beast.</p>
<p>As the <i>capataz</i> stopped speaking, and we all sat silent
for a short time, the cries were redoubled. They certainly
were not calculated to raise our spirits: some were
wild and unearthly in the extreme, some were growls of
evident anger, some mere groanings, as if they proceeded
from creatures dying in pain and torment, while others
again began in a low and most mournful moan, rising
quickly into a hideous, frightened, broken, or gurgling
yell, then dying away again in dreary cadence.</p>
<p>I could not help shuddering a little as I looked behind
me into the darkness of the forest. The whole place had
an uncanny, haunted sort of look, and I even began to
wonder whether we might not possibly be the victims of
enchantment. Would we awaken in the morning and find
no trees, no wood, no water, only a green cañon, with cliffs
and hills on every side?</p>
<p>'Look, look!' I cried, starting half up at last. 'Did
none of you see that?'</p>
<p>'What is it? Speak, Murdoch!' cried Archie; 'your
face is enough to frighten a fellow.'</p>
<p>I pressed my hand to my forehead.</p>
<p>'Surely,' I said, 'I am going to be ill, but I thought I
could distinctly see a tall grey figure standing among the
trees.'</p>
<p>We resumed talking, but in a lower, quieter key. The
events of the evening, our strange surroundings, the
whispering trees, the occasional strange cries, and the
mournful beauty of the night, seemed to have cast a
glamour over every heart that was here; and though it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
was now long past our usual hour for bed, no one
appeared wishful to retire.</p>
<p>All at once Archie grasped me by the shoulder and
glanced fearfully into the forest behind me. I dared
scarcely turn my head till the click of Yambo's revolver
reassured me.</p>
<p>Yes, there was the figure in grey moving silently towards
us.</p>
<p>'Speak, quick, else I fire!' shouted our <i>capataz</i>.</p>
<p>'<i>Ave Maria!</i>'</p>
<p>Yambo lowered the revolver, and we all started to our
feet to confront the figure in grey.

<p>The figure in grey&mdash;the grey was a garment of skin,
cap, coat, breeches, and even boots, apparently all of
the same material&mdash;approached with extended hand. We
could see now it was no ghost who stood before us, but a
man of flesh and blood. Very solid flesh, too, judging
from the cheeks that surmounted the silvery beard. The
moon shone full on his face, and a very pleasant one it
was, with a bright, merry twinkle in the eye.</p>
<p>'Who are you?' said I.</p>
<p>'Nay, pardon me,' was the bold reply, 'but the question
would come with greater propriety from my lips. I need
not ask it, however. You are right welcome to my little
kingdom. You are, I can see, a party of roving hunters.
Few of your sort have ever come here before, I can tell
you.'</p>
<p>'And you?' I said, smiling.</p>
<p>'<i>I</i> am&mdash;but there, what need to give myself a name?
I have not heard my name for years. Call me Smith,
Jones, Robinson; call me a hunter, a trapper, a madman,
a fool&mdash;anything.'</p>
<p>'A hermit, anyhow,' said Dugald.</p>
<p>'Yes, boy, a hermit.'</p>
<p>'And an Englishman?'</p>
<p>'No; I am a Portuguese by birth, but I have lived in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
every country under the sun, and here I am at last. Have
I introduced myself sufficiently?'</p>
<p>'No,' I said; 'but sit down. You have,' I continued,
'only introduced yourself sufficiently to excite our
curiosity. Yours must be a strange story.'</p>
<p>'Oh, anybody and everybody who lives for over fifty
years in the world as I have done has a strange story, if
he cared to tell it. Mine is too long, and some of it too
sad. I have been a soldier, a sailor, a traveller; I have
been wealthy, I have been poor; I have been in love&mdash;my
love left <i>me</i>. I forgot <i>her</i>. I have done everything
except commit crime. I have not run away from anywhere,
gentlemen. There is no blood on my hands. I
can still pray. I still love. She whom I love is here.'</p>
<p>'Oh!' cried Dugald, 'won't you bring the lady?'</p>
<p>The hermit laughed.</p>
<p>'She <i>is</i> here, there, all around us. My mistress is
Nature. Ah! boys,' he said, turning to us with such a
kind look, 'Nature breaks no hearts; and the more you
love her, the more she loves you, and leads you upwards&mdash;always
upwards, never down.'</p>
<p>It was strange, but from the very moment he began to
talk both my brothers and I began to like this hermit.
His ways and his manners were quite irresistible, and
before we separated we felt as if we had known him all
our lives.</p>
<p>He was the last man my brothers and I saw that night,
and he was the first we met in the morning. He had
donned a light cloth poncho and a broad sombrero hat,
and really looked both handsome and picturesque.</p>
<p>We went away together, and bathed, and I told him of
Dugald's adventure. He looked interested, patted my
brother's shoulder, and said:</p>
<p>'Poor boy, what a narrow escape you have had!</p>
<p>'The stream,' he continued, 'that flows through this
strange glen rises in the hills about five miles up. It
rises from huge springs&mdash;you shall see them&mdash;flows through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
the woods, and is sucked into the earth in the middle of
that lake. I have lived here for fifteen years. Walk with
me up the glen. Leave your rifles in your tents; there is
nothing to hurt.'</p>
<p>We obeyed, and soon joined him, and together we
strolled up the path that led close by the banks of a
beautiful stream. We were enchanted with the beauty displayed
everywhere about us, and our guide seemed pleased.</p>
<p>'Almost all the trees and shrubs you see,' he said, 'I
have planted, and many of the beautiful flowers&mdash;the
orchids, the climbers, and creepers, all are my pets. Those
I have not planted I have encouraged, and I believe they
all know me.'</p>
<p>At this moment a huge puma came bounding along the
path, but stopped when he saw us.</p>
<p>'Don't be afraid, boys,' said the hermit. 'This, too, is
a pet. Do not be shy, Jacko. These are friends.'</p>
<p>The puma smelt us, then rubbed his great head against
his master's leg, and trotted along by his side.</p>
<p>'I have several. You will not shoot while you live
here? Thanks. I have a large family. The woods are
filled with my family. I have brought them from far and
near, birds and beasts of every kind. They see us now,
but are shy.'</p>
<p>'I say, sir,' said Dugald, 'you are Adam, and this is
Paradise.'</p>
<p>The hermit smiled in recognition of the compliment,
and we now approached his house.</p>
<p>'I must confess,' I said, 'that a more Crusoe-looking
establishment it has never been my luck to behold.'</p>
<p>'You are young yet,' replied the hermit, laughing,
'although you speak so like a book.</p>
<p>'Here we are, then, in my compound. The fence, you
see, is a very open one, for I desire neither to exclude the
sunshine nor the fresh air from my vegetables. Observe,'
he continued, 'that my hut, which consists of one large
room, stands in the centre of a gravel square.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span></p>
<p>'It is strange-looking gravel!' said Dugald.</p>
<p>'It is nearly altogether composed of salt. My house is
built of stone, but it is plastered with a kind of cement I
can dig here in the hills. There is not a crevice nor
hollow in all the wall, and it is four feet thick. The floor
is also cemented, and so is the roof.'</p>
<p>'And this,' I remarked, 'is no doubt for coolness in
summer.'</p>
<p>'Yes, and warmth in winter, if it comes to that, and
also for cleanliness. Yonder is a ladder that leads to the
roof. Up there I lounge and think, drink my <i>maté</i> and
read. Oh yes, I have plenty of books, which I keep in a
safe with bitter-herb powder&mdash;to save them, you know,
from literary ants and other insects who possess an ambition
to solve the infinite. Observe again, that I have neither
porch nor verandah to my house, and that the windows
are small. I object to a porch and to climbing things on
the same principle that I do to creeping, crawling creatures.
The world is wide enough for us all. But they must keep
to their side of the house at night, and I to mine. And
mine is the inside. This is also the reason why most of
the gravel is composed of salt. As a rule, creepies don't
like it.'</p>
<p>'Oh, I'm glad you told us that,' said Archie; 'I shall
make my mule carry a bushel of it. I'm glad you don't
like creepies, sir.'</p>
<p>'But, boy, I <i>do</i>. Only I object to them indoors. Walk
in. Observe again, as a showman would say, how very
few my articles of furniture are. Notice, however, that
they are all scrupulously clean. Nevertheless, I have
every convenience. That thong-bottomed sofa is my bed.
My skins and rugs are kept in a bag all day, and hermetically
sealed against the prying probosces of insectivora.
Here is my stove, yonder my kitchen and scullery, and
there hangs my armoury. Now I am going to call my
servant. He is a Highlander like yourselves, boys; at
any rate, he appears to be, for he never wears anything else
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
except the kilt, and he talks a language which, though I
have had him for ten years, I do not yet understand.
Archie, Archie, where are you?'</p>
<p>'Another Archie!' said Dugald, 'and a countryman,
too?'</p>
<p>'He is shy of strangers. Archie, boy! He is swinging
in some tree-top, no doubt.'</p>
<p>'What a queer fellow he must be! Wears nothing
but the kilt, speaks Gaelic, swings in tree-tops, and is
shy! A <i>rara avis</i> indeed.'</p>
<p>'Ah! here he comes. Archie, spread the awning
out of doors, lay the table, bring a jug of cold <i>maté</i>
and the cigars.'</p>
<p>Truly Archie was a curious Highlander. He was quite
as tall as our Archie, and though the hermit assured us
he was only a baby when he bought him in Central Africa
for about sevenpence halfpenny in Indian coin, he had
now the wrinkled face of an old man of ninety&mdash;wrinkled,
wizened, and weird. But his eye was singularly bright
and young-looking. In his hand he carried a long pole
from which he had bitten all the bark, and his only dress
was a little petticoat of skunk skin, which the hermit
called his kilt. He was, in fact, an African orang-outang.</p>
<p>'Come and shake hands with the good gentlemen,
Archie.'</p>
<p>Archie knitted his brows, and looked at us without
moving. The hermit laughingly handed him a pair of big
horn-rimmed spectacles. These he put on with all the
gravity of some ancient professor of Sanscrit, then looked
us all over once again.</p>
<p>We could stand this no longer, and so burst into a chorus
of laughing.</p>
<p>'Don't laugh longer than you can help, boys. See,
Archie is angry.'</p>
<p>Archie was. He showed a mouth full of fearful-looking
fangs, and fingered his club in a way that was not
pleasant.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>'Archie, you may have some peaches presently.'</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<a name='linki_11' id='linki_11'></a>
<img src='images/illus213.jpg' alt='' title='' style='width: 391px; height: 394px;' /><br />
</div>

<p>Archie grew pleasant again in a moment, and advanced
and shook hands with us all round, looking all the time,
however, as if he had some silent sorrow somewhere.  I
confess he wrung our hands pretty hard. Neither my
brother nor I made any remark, but when it came to Archie's
turn&mdash;</p>
<p>'Honolulu!' he shouted, shaking his fingers, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
blowing on them. 'I believe he has made the blood
come!'</p>
<p>'I suppose,' said Dugald, laughing, 'he knows you are
a namesake.'</p>
<p>Off went the great baboon, and to our intense
astonishment spread the awning, placed table and
camp-stools under it, and fetched the cold <i>maté</i> with
all the gravity and decorum of the chief steward on a
first-class liner.</p>
<p>I looked at my brothers, and they looked at me.</p>
<p>'You seem all surprised,' the hermit said, 'but remember
that in olden times it was no rare thing to see baboons of
this same species waiting at the tables of your English
nobility. Well, I am not only a noble, but a king; why
should not I also have an anthropoid as a butler and
valet?'</p>
<p>'I confess,' I said, 'I for one am very much surprised at
all I have seen and all that has happened since last night,
and I really cannot help thinking that presently I shall
awake and find, as the story-books say, it is all a dream.'</p>
<p>'You will find it all a very substantial dream, I do assure
you, sir. But help yourself to the <i>maté</i>. You will find it
better than any imported stuff.'</p>
<p>'Archie! Archie! Where are you?'</p>
<p>'Ah! ah! Yah, yah, yah!' cried Archie, hopping round
behind his master.</p>
<p>'The sugar, Archie.'</p>
<p>'Ah, ah, ah! Yah, yah!'</p>
<p>'Is that Gaelic, Dugald?' said our Archie.</p>
<p>'Not quite, my cockney cousin.'</p>
<p>'I thought not.'</p>
<p>'Why?' said Dugald.</p>
<p>'It is much more intelligible.'</p>
<p>The hermit laughed.</p>
<p>'I think, Dugald,' he said, 'your cousin has the best of
you.'</p>
<p>He then made us tell him all our strange though brief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
history, as the reader already knows it. If he asked us
questions, however, it was evidently not for the sake of
inquisitiveness, but to exchange experiences, and support
the conversation. He was quite as ready to impart as to
solicit information; but somehow we felt towards him as
if he were an elder brother or uncle; and this only proves
the hermit was a perfect gentleman.</p>
<p>'Shall you live much longer in this beautiful wilderness?'
asked Donald.</p>
<p>'Well, I will tell you all about that,' replied the hermit.
'And the all is very brief. When I came here first I had
no intention of making a long stay.  I was a trapper and
hunter then pure and simple, and sold my skins and other
odds and ends which these hills yield&mdash;and what these are
I must not even tell to you&mdash;journeying over the Andes with
mules twice every year for that purpose.  But gradually,
as my trees and bushes and all the beauty of this wild
garden-glen grew up around me, and so many of God's wild
children came to keep me company, I got to love my strange
life. So from playing at being a hermit, I dare say I have
come to be one in reality. And now, though I have money&mdash;much
more than one would imagine&mdash;in the Chilian
banks, I do not seem to care to enter civilized life again.
For some years back I have been promising myself a city
holiday, but I keep putting it off and off.  I should not
wonder if it never comes, or, to speak more correctly, I
should wonder if it ever came. Oh, I dare say I shall die
in my own private wilderness here, with no one to close
my eyes but old Archie.'</p>
<p>'Do you still go on journeys to Chili?'</p>
<p>'I still go twice a year. I have strong fleet mules. I
go once in summer and once in winter.'</p>
<p>'Going in winter across the Andes! That must be a
terribly dreary journey.'</p>
<p>'It is. Yet it has its advantages. I never have to flee
from hostile Indians then. They do not like the hills in
winter.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>'Are you not afraid of the pampas Indians?'</p>
<p>'No, not at all. They visit me occasionally here, but do
not stay long. I trust them, I am kind to them, and I
have nothing they could find to steal, even if they cared to
be dishonest. But they are <i>not</i>. They are good-hearted
fellows in their own way.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' I said, 'very much in their own way.'</p>
<p>'My dear boy,' said the hermit, 'you do not know all.
A different policy would have made those Indians the sworn
friends, the faithful allies and servants of the white man.
They would have kept then to their own hunting-grounds,
they would have brought to you wealth of skins, and wealth
of gold and silver, too, for believe me, they (the Indians)
have secrets that the white trader little wots of. No, it is
the dishonest, blood-stained policy of the Republic that
has made the Indian what he is&mdash;his hand against every
man, every man's hand against him.'</p>
<p>'But they even attack you at times, I think you gave us
to understand?'</p>
<p>'Nay, not the pampas or pampean Indians: only
prowling gipsy tribes from the far north. Even they will
not when they know me better. My fame is spreading as
a seer.'</p>
<p>'As a seer?'</p>
<p>'Yes, a kind of prophet. Do not imagine that I foster
any such folly, only they will believe that, living here all
alone in the wilds, I must have communication with&mdash;ha!
ha! a worse world than this.'</p>
<p>As we rose to go the hermit held out his hand.</p>
<p>'Come and see me to-night,' he said; 'and let me advise
you to make this glen your headquarters for a time. The
hills and glens and bush for leagues around abound in
game. Then your way back lies across a pampa north and
east of here; not the road you have come.'</p>
<p>'By the by,' said Archie, 'before we go, I want to ask
you the question which tramps always put in England:
"Are the dogs all safe?"'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>'Ah,' said the hermit, smiling, 'I know what you mean.
Yes, the dogs are safe. My pet pumas will not come near
you. I do not think that even my jaguars would object to
your presence; but for safety's sake Archie shall go along
with you, and he shall also come for you in the evening.
Give him these peaches when you reach camp. They are
our own growing, and Archie dotes upon them.'</p>
<p>So away back by the banks of the stream we went, our
strange guide, club in hand, going hopping on before. It
did really seem all like a scene of enchantment.</p>
<p>We gave Archie the peaches, and he looked delighted.</p>
<p>'Good-bye, old man,' said Dugald, as he presented him
with his.</p>
<p>'Speak a word or two of Gaelic to him,' said our
Archie.</p>
<p>Sandie Donaldson was indeed astonished at all we told
him.</p>
<p>'I suppose it's all right,' he said, 'but dear me, that was
an uncanny-looking creature you had hirpling on in front
of you!'</p>
<p>In the evening, just as we had returned from a most
successful guanaco hunt, we found Donaldson's uncanny
creature coming along the path.</p>
<p>'I suppose he means us to dine with him,' I remarked.</p>
<p>'Ah, ah, ah! Yah, ah, yah!' cried the baboon.</p>
<p>'Well, will you come, Sandie?'</p>
<p>Sandie shook his head.</p>
<p>'Not to-night,' said Sandie. 'Take care of yourselves,
boys. Mind what the old proverb says: "They need a
lang spoon wha sup wi' the deil."'</p>
<p>We found the hermit at his gate, and glad he seemed to
see us.</p>
<p>'I've been at home all the afternoon,' he said, 'cooking
your dinner. Most enjoyable work, I can assure you. All
the vegetables are fresh, and even the curry has been grown
on the premises. I hope you are fond of armadillo; that
is a favourite dish of mine. But here we have roast ducks,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
partridges, and something that perhaps you have never
tasted before, roast or boiled. For bread we have biscuit;
for wine we have <i>maté</i> and milk. My goats come every
night to be milked. Archie does the milking as well as
any man could. Ah, here come my dogs.'</p>
<p>Two deerhounds trotted up and made friends with us.</p>
<p>'I bought them from a roving Scot two years ago while
on a visit to Chili.'</p>
<p>'How about the pumas? Don't they&mdash;'</p>
<p>'No, they come from the trees to sleep with Rob and
Rory. Even the jaguars do not attempt to touch them. Sit
down; you see I dine early. We will have time before
dusk to visit some of my pets. I hope they did not keep
you awake.'</p>
<p>'No, but the noise would have done so, had we not known
what they were.'</p>
<p>Conversation never once flagged all the time we sat at
table. The hermit himself had put most of the dishes
down, but Archie duly waited behind his master's chair,
and brought both the <i>maté</i> and the milk, as well as the
fruit. This dessert was of the most tempting description;
and not even at our own <i>estancia</i> had I tasted more delicious
grapes. But there were many kinds of fruit here we had
never even seen before. As soon as we were done the waiter
had <i>his</i> repast, and the amount of fruit he got through
surprised us beyond measure. He squatted on the ground
to eat. Well, when he commenced his dinner he looked
a little old gentleman of somewhat spare habit; when he
rose up&mdash;by the aid of his pole&mdash;he was decidedly plump,
not to say podgy. Even his cheeks were puffed out; and
no wonder, they were stuffed with nuts to eat at his
leisure.</p>
<p>'I dare say Archie eats at all odd hours,' I said.</p>
<p>'No, he does not,' replied the hermit. 'I never encouraged
him to do so, and now he is quite of my way of thinking, and
never eats between meals. But come, will you light a
cigarette and stroll round with me?'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span></p>
<p>'We will stroll round without the cigarette,' I said.</p>
<p>'Then fill your pockets with nuts and raisins; you must
do something.'</p>
<p>'Feed the birds, Archie.'</p>
<p>'Ah, ah, ah! Yah, ah! Yah, yah!'</p>
<p>'The birds need not come to be fed; there is enough
and to spare for them in the woods, but they think whatever
we eat must be extra nice.  We have all kinds of birds
except the British sparrow. I really hope you have not
brought him.  They say he follows Englishmen to the
uttermost parts of the world.'</p>
<p>We waited for a moment, and wondered at the flocks of
lovely bright-winged doves and pigeons and other birds
that had alighted round the table to receive their daily
dole, then followed our hermit guide, to feast our eyes on
other wonders not a whit less wonderful than all we had
seen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>WILD ADVENTURES ON PRAIRIE AND PAMPAS.</h3>
</div>

<p>If I were to describe even one half of the strange
creatures we saw in the hermit's glen, the reader
would be tired before I had finished, and even then I
should not have succeeded in conveying anything like a
correct impression of this floral wilderness and natural
menagerie.</p>
<p>It puzzled me to know, and it puzzles me still, how
so many wild creatures could have been got together in
one place.</p>
<p>'I brought many of them here,' the hermit told us, 'but
the others came, lured, no doubt, by the water, the trees,
and the flowers.'</p>
<p>'But was the water here when you arrived?'</p>
<p>'Oh yes, else I would not have settled down here. The
glen was a sort of oasis even then, and there were more
bushes and trees than ever I had seen before in one place.
The ducks and geese and swans, in fact, all the web-footed
fraternity, had been here before me, and many birds and
beasts besides&mdash;the biscachas, the armadilloes, the beetle-eating
pichithiego, for instance&mdash;the great ant-eater, and
the skunk&mdash;I have banished that, however&mdash;wolves, foxes,
kites, owls, and condors. I also found peccaries, and some
deer. These latter, and the guanaco, give me a wide berth
now. They do not care for dogs, pumas, and jaguars.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
Insects are rather too numerous, and I have several species
of snakes.'</p>
<p>Archie's&mdash;<i>our</i> Archie's&mdash;face fell.</p>
<p>'Are they?' he began, 'are they very&mdash;'</p>
<p>'Very beautiful? Yes; indeed, some are charming in
colour. One, for example, is of the brightest crimson
streaked with black.'</p>
<p>'I was not referring to their beauty; I meant were they
dangerous?'</p>
<p>'Well, I never give them a chance to bite me, and I do
not think they want to; but all snakes are to be avoided
and left severely alone.'</p>
<p>'Or killed, sir?'</p>
<p>'Yes, perhaps, if killed outright; for the pampan
Indians have an idea that if a rattlesnake be only wounded,
he will come back for revenge. But let us change the
subject. You see those splendid butterflies? Well, by
and by the moths will be out; they are equally lovely,
but when I first came here there were very few of either.
They followed the flowers, and the humming-birds came
next, and many other lovely gay-coloured little songsters.
I introduced most of the parrots and toucans. There are
two up there even now. They would come down if you
were not here.'</p>
<p>'They are very funny-looking, but very pretty,' said
Dugald. 'I could stop and look at them for hours.'</p>
<p>'But we must proceed. Here are the trees where the
parrots mostly live. Early as it is, you see they are
retiring.'</p>
<p>What a sight! What resplendency of colour and
beauty! Such bright metallic green, lustrous orange,
crimson and bronze!</p>
<p>'Why do they frequent this particular part of the
wood?' said Dugald.</p>
<p>'Ah, boy,' replied the hermit, 'I see you want to know
everything. Don't be ashamed of that; you are a true
naturalist at heart. Well, the parrots like to be by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
themselves, and few of my birds care to live among them.
You will notice, too, that yonder are some eucalyptus
trees, and farther up some wide-spreading, open-branched
trees, with flowers creeping and clinging around the stems.
Parrots love those trees, because while there they have
sunshine, and because birds of prey cannot easily tell
which is parrot and which is flower or flame-coloured
lichen.'</p>
<p>'That is an advantage.'</p>
<p>'Well, yes; but it is an advantage that also has a disadvantage,
for our serpents are so lovely that even they are
not easily seen by the parrots when they wriggle up among
the orchids.'</p>
<p>'Can the parrots defend themselves against snakes?'</p>
<p>'Yes, they can, and sometimes even kill them. I have
noticed this, but as a rule they prefer to scare them off by
screaming. And they can scream, too. "As deaf as an
adder," is a proverb; well, I believe it was the parrot that
first deafened the adder, if deaf it be.'</p>
<p>'Have you many birds of prey?'</p>
<p>'Yes, too many. But, see here.'</p>
<p>'I see nothing.'</p>
<p>'No, but you soon shall. Here in the sunniest bank, and
in this sunniest part of the wood, dwell a family of that
remarkable creature the blind armadillo, or pichithiego. I
wonder if any one is at home.'</p>
<p>As he spoke, the hermit knelt down and buried his
hands in the sand, soon bringing to the surface a very
curious little animal indeed, one of the tenderest of all
armadilloes.</p>
<p>It shivered as it cuddled into the hermit's arms.</p>
<p>Dugald laughed aloud.</p>
<p>'Why,' he cried, 'it seems to end suddenly half-way
down; and that droll tail looks stuck on for fun.'</p>
<p>'Yes, it is altogether a freak of Nature, and the wonder
to me is how, being so tender, it lives here at all. You see
how small and delicate a thing it is. They say it is blind,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
but you observe it is not; although the creatures live
mostly underground. They also say that the <i>chlamyphorus
truncatus</i>&mdash;which is the grand name for my wee friend,&mdash;carries
its young under this pink or rosy shell jacket, but
this I very much doubt. Now go to bed, little one.</p>
<p>'I have prettier pets than even these, two species of
agoutis, for instance, very handsome little fellows indeed,
and like rats in many of their ways and in many of their
droll antics. They are not fond of strangers, but often
come out to meet me in my walks about the woods.
They live in burrows, but run about plentifully enough in
the open air, although their enemies are very numerous.
Even the Indians capture and eat them, as often raw as not.</p>
<p>'You have heard of the peccary. Well, I have never
encouraged these wild wee pigs, and for some years after
I came, there were none in the woods. One morning I
found them, however, all over the place in herds. I never
knew where they came from, nor how they found us out.
But I do know that for more than two years I had to
wage constant war with them.'</p>
<p>'They were good to eat?'</p>
<p>'They were tolerably good, especially the young, but I
did not want for food; and, besides, they annoyed my
wee burrowing pets, and, in fact, they deranged everything,
and got themselves thoroughly hated wherever
they went.'</p>
<p>'And how did you get rid of them?'</p>
<p>'They disappeared entirely one night as if by magic,
and I have never seen nor heard one since. But here we
are at my stable.'</p>
<p>'I see no stable,' I said.</p>
<p>'Well, it is an enclosure of half an acre, and my mules
and goats are corralled here at night.'</p>
<p>'Do not the pumas or jaguars attempt to molest the
mules or goats?'</p>
<p>'Strange to say, they do not, incredible as it may seem.
But come in, and you will see a happy family.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>'What are these?' cried Dugald. 'Dogs?'</p>
<p>'No, boy, one is a wolf, the other two are foxes. All
three were suckled by one of my dogs, and here they are.
You see, they play with the goats, and are exceedingly
fond of the mules. They positively prefer the company
of the mules to mine, although when I come here with
their foster-dam, the deerhound, they all condescend to
leave this compound and to follow me through the woods.</p>
<p>'Here come my mules. Are they not beauties?'</p>
<p>We readily admitted they were, never having seen
anything in size and shape to equal them.</p>
<p>'Now, you asked me about the jaguars. Mine are but
few; they are also very civil; but I do believe that one
of these mules would be a match even for a jaguar. If
the jaguar had one kick he would never need another.
The goats&mdash;here they come&mdash;herd close to the mules, and
the foxes and wolf are sentinels, and give an alarm if
even a strange monkey comes near the compound. Ah,
here come my pet toucans!'</p>
<p>These strange-beaked birds came floating down from a
tree to the number of nearly a dozen, nor did they look
at all ungainly, albeit their beaks are so wondrously
large.</p>
<p>'What do they eat?'</p>
<p>'Everything; but fruit is the favourite dish with them.
But look up. Do you see that speck against the cloud
yonder, no bigger in appearance than the lark that sings
above the cornfields in England? See how it circles and
sweeps round and round. Do you know that bird is a
mile above us?'</p>
<p>'That is wonderful!'</p>
<p>'And what think you it is doing? Why, it is eyeing
you and me. It is my pet condor. The only bird I do
not feed; but the creature loves me well for all that. He
is suspicious of your presence. Now watch, and I will
bring him down like an arrow.'</p>
<p>The hermit waved a handkerchief in a strange way,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
and with one fell downward swoop, in a few seconds the
monster eagle had alighted near us.</p>
<p>Well may the condor be called 'king of the air,'
I thought, for never before had I seen so majestic a bird.
He was near us now, and scrutinizing us with that bold
fierce eye of his, as some chieftain in the brave days of
old might have gazed upon spies that he was about to
order away to execution. I believed then&mdash;and I am
still of the same opinion&mdash;that there was something akin
to pity and scorn in his steadfast looks, as if we had
been brought here for his especial delectation and
study.</p>
<p>'Poor wretched bipeds!' he seemed to say; 'not even
possessed of feathers, no clothes of their own, obliged to
wrap themselves in the hair and skins of dead quadrupeds.
No beaks, no talons; not even the wings of a
miserable bat. Never knew what it was to mount and
soar into the blue sky to meet the morning sun; never
floated free as the winds far away in the realms of space;
never saw the world spread out beneath them like a
living panorama, its woods and forests mere patches of
green or purple, its lakes like sheets of shimmering ice,
its streams like threads of spiders' webs before the day
has drunk the dew, its very deserts dwarfed by distance
till the guanacos and the ostriches<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> look like mites, and
herds of wild horses appear but crawling ants. Never
knew what it was to circle round the loftiest summits of
the snow-clad voiceless Andes, while down in the valleys
beneath dark clouds rolled fiercely on, and lightnings
played across the darkness; nor to perch cool and safe on
peak or pinnacle, while below on earth's dull level the
hurricane Pampero was levelling house and hut and tree;
or the burning breath of the Zonda was sweeping over the
land, scorching every flower and leaf, drinking every
drop of dew, draining even the blood of moving beings till
eyes ache and brains reel, till man himself looks haggard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
wild, and worn, and the beasts of the forest, hidden in
darkling caves, go mad and rend their young.'</p>
<p>The hermit returned with us to our camping-ground
just as great bats began to circle and wheel around, as
butterflies were folding their wings and going to sleep
beneath the leaves, and the whole woodland glen began
to awake to the screaming of night-birds, to the mournful
howling of strange monkeys, and hoarse growl of beasts
of prey.</p>
<p>We sat together till far into the night listening to story
after story of the wild adventures of our new but nameless
hero, and till the moon&mdash;so high above us now that the
pine-trees no longer cast their shadows across the glade&mdash;warned
us it was time to retire.</p>
<p>'Good night, boys all,' said the hermit; 'I will come
again to-morrow.'</p>
<p>He turned and walked away, his <i>potro</i> boots making no
sound on the sward. We watched him till the gloom of
the forest seemed to swallow him up.</p>
<p>'What a strange being!' said Archie, with a sigh.</p>
<p>'And what a lonely life to lead!' said Donald.</p>
<p>'Ah!' said Dugald, 'you may sigh as you like, Archie,
and say what you please, I think there is no life so jolly,
and I've half a mind to turn hermit myself.'</p>
<p>We lived in the glen for many weeks. No better or
more idyllic headquarters could possibly have been found
or even imagined, while all around us was a hunter's
paradise. We came at last to look upon the hermit's dell
as our home, but we did not bivouac there every night.
There were times when we wandered too far away in
pursuit of the guanaco, the puma, jaguar, or even the
ostrich, which we found feeding on plains at no great
distance from our camp.</p>
<p>It was a glorious treat for all of us to find ourselves on
these miniature pampas, across which we could gallop
unfettered and free.</p>
<p>Under the tuition of Yambo, our <i>capataz</i>, and the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
Gauchos, we became adepts in the use of both bolas and
lasso. Away up among the beetling crags and in the deep,
gloomy caverns we had to stalk the guanacos as the Swiss
mountaineer stalks the chamois. Oh, our adventures
among the rocks were sometimes thrilling enough! But
here on the plains another kind of tactics was pursued.
I doubt if we could have ridden near enough to the
ostriches to bola them, so our plan was to make <i>détours</i> on
the pampas until we had outflanked, encircled, and
altogether puzzled our quarry. Then riding in a zigzag
fashion, gradually we narrowed the ring till near enough to
fire. When nearer still the battue and stampede commenced,
and the scene was then wild and confusing in the
extreme. The frightened whinny or neigh of the guanacos,
the hoarse whirr of the flying ostriches, the shouts of the
Gauchos, the bark and yell of dogs, the whistling noise of
lasso or bolas, the sharp ringing of rifle and revolver&mdash;all
combined to form a medley, a huntsman's chorus which
no one who has once heard it and taken part in it is likely
to forget.</p>
<p>When too far from the camp, then we hobbled our
horses at the nearest spot where grass and water could be
found, and after supping on broiled guanaco steak and
ostrich's gizzard&mdash;in reality right dainty morsels&mdash;we
would roll ourselves in our guanaco robes, and with saddles
for pillows go quietly to sleep. Ah, I never sleep so soundly
now as I used to then beneath the stars, fanned by the
night breeze; and although the dews lay heavy on our
robes in the morning, we awoke as fresh as the daisies and
as happy as puma cubs that only wake to play.</p>
<p>We began to get wealthy ere long with a weight of
skins of birds and beasts. Some of the most valuable of
these were procured from a species of otter that lived in
the blackest, deepest pools of a stream we had fallen in
with in our wanderings. The Gauchos had a kind of
superstitious dread of the huge beast, whom they not
inappropriately termed the river tiger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></p>
<p>We had found our dogs of the greatest use in the
hills, especially our monster bloodhound-mastiffs. These
animals possessed nearly all the tracking qualities of the
bloodhound, with more fierceness and speed than the
mastiff, and nearly the same amount of strength. Their
courage, too, and general hardiness were very great.</p>
<p>Among our spoils we could count the skins of no less
than fifteen splendid pumas. Several of these had shown
fight. Once, I remember, Archie had leapt from his
horse and was making his way through a patch of bush
on the plains, in pursuit of a young guanaco which he had
wounded. He was all alone: not even a dog with him;
but Yambo's quick ear had detected the growl of a lion in
that bit of scrub, and he at once started off three of his
best dogs to the scene of Archie's adventure. Not two
hundred yards away myself, but on high ground, I could
see everything, though powerless to aid. I could see
Archie hurrying back through the bush. I could see the
puma spring, and my poor cousin fall beneath the blow&mdash;then
the death struggle began. It was fearful while it
lasted, which was only the briefest possible time, for, even
as I looked, the dogs were on the puma. The worrying,
yelling, and gurgling sounds were terrible. I saw the
puma on its hind legs, I saw one dog thrown high in the
air, two others on the wild beast's neck, and next moment
Yambo himself was there, with every other horseman save
myself tearing along full tilt for the battle-field.</p>
<p>Yambo's long spear had done the work, and all the
noise soon ceased. Though stunned and frightened,
Archie was but little the worse. One dog was killed.
It seemed to have been Yambo's favourite. I could not
help expressing my astonishment at the exhibition of
Yambo's grief. Here was a man, once one of the
cruellest and most remorseless of desert wanderers, whose
spear and knife had many a time and oft drunk human
blood, shedding tears over the body of his poor dog! Nor
would he leave the place until he had dug a grave, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
placing the bleeding remains therein, sadly and slowly
covered them up.</p>
<p>But Yambo would meet his faithful hound again in the
happy hunting-grounds somewhere beyond the sky. That,
at least, was Yambo's creed, and who should dare deny
him the comfort and joy the thought brings him!</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was now the sweetest season of all the year in the
hills&mdash;the Indian summer. The fierce heat had fled to
the north, fled beyond the salt plains of San Juan, beyond
the wild desert lands of Rioja and arid sands of Catamarca,
lingering still, perhaps, among the dreamland gardens of
Tucuman, and reaching its eternal home among the sun-kissed
forests of leafy Brazil and Bolivia. The autumn
days were getting shorter, the sky was now more soft, the
air more cool and balmy, while evening after evening the
sun went down amidst a fiery magnificence of colouring
that held us spellbound and silent to behold.</p>
<p>A month and more in the hermit's glen! We could
hardly believe it. How quickly the time had flown! How
quickly time always does fly when one is happy!</p>
<p>And now our tents are struck, our mules are laden. We
have but to say good-bye to the solitary being who has made
the garden in the wilderness his home, and go on our way.</p>
<p>'Good-bye!'</p>
<p>'Good-bye!'</p>
<p>Little words, but sometimes <i>so</i> hard to say.</p>
<p>We had actually begun to like&mdash;ay, even to love the
hermit, and we had not found it out till now. But I
noticed tears in Dugald's eye, and I am not quite sure my
own were not moist as we said farewell.</p>
<p>We glanced back as we rode away to wave our hands
once more. The hermit was leaning against a tree. Just
then the sun came struggling out from under a cloud,
the shadow beneath the tree darkened and darkened, till
it swallowed him up.</p>
<p>And we never saw the hermit more.

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>ADVENTURE WITH A TIGER.</h3>
</div>

<p>Two years more have passed away, four years in all,
since we first set foot in the Silver West. What happy,
blithesome years they had been, too! Every day had
brought its duties, every duty its pleasures as well. During
all this time we could not look back with regret to one
unpleasant hour. Sometimes we had endured some crosses
as well, but we brothers bore them, I believe, without a
murmur, and Moncrieff without one complaining word.</p>
<p>'Boys,' he would say, quietly, 'nobody gets it all his own
way in this world. We must just learn to take the thick
wi' the thin.'</p>
<p>Moncrieff was somewhat of a proverbial philosopher;
but had he been entrusted with the task of selecting
proverbs that should smooth one's path in life, I feel sure
they would have been good ones.</p>
<p>Strath Coila New, as we called the now green valley in
which our little colony had been founded, had improved
to a wonderful extent in so brief a time. The settlers
had completed their houses long ago; they, like ourselves,
had laid out their fields and farms and planted their
vineyards; the hedges were green and flowering; the
poplar-trees and willows had sprung skywards as if
influenced by magic&mdash;the magic of a virgin soil; the
fields were green with waving grain and succulent lucerne;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
the vines needed the help of man to aid them in supporting
their wondrous wealth of grapes; fruit grew everywhere;
birds sang everywhere, and to their music were added
sounds even sweeter still to our ears&mdash;the lowing of herds
of sleek fat cattle, the bleating armies of sheep, the home-like
noise of poultry and satisfied grunting of lazy pigs.
The latter sometimes fed on peaches that would have
brought tears of joy to the eyes of many an English market
gardener.</p>
<p>Our villa was complete now; wings and tower, and
terraced lawns leading down to the lake, close beside
which Dugald had erected a boat-house that was in itself
like a little fairy palace. Dugald had always a turn for
the romantic, and nothing would suit him by way of a boat
except a gondola. What an amount of time and taste he
had bestowed on it too! and how the Gaucho carpenters
had worked and slaved to please him and make it complete!
But there it was at last, a thing of beauty, in all conscience&mdash;prows
and bows, cushioned seats, and oars, and awnings,
all complete.</p>
<p>It was his greatest pleasure to take auntie, Aileen, and
old Jenny out to skim the lake in this gondola, and sit for
long happy hours reading or fishing.</p>
<p>Even Bombazo used to form an item in these pleasant
little excursions. He certainly was no use with an oar,
but it was the 'bravo' captain's delight to dress as a
troubadour and sit twanging the light guitar under the
awnings, while Aileen and auntie plied the oars.</p>
<p>Dugald was still our mighty hunter, the fearless Nimrod
of hill and strath and glen. But he was amply supported
in all his adventures by Archie, who had wonderfully
changed for the better. He was brown and hard now, an
excellent horseman, and crack shot with either the revolver
or rifle.</p>
<p>Between the two of them, though ably assisted by a
Gaucho or two, they had fitted up the ancient ruined
monastery far away among the hills as a kind of shooting-box,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
and here they spent many a day, and many a night as
well. Archie had long since become acclimatized to all kinds
of creepies&mdash;they no longer possessed any terrors for him.</p>
<p>The ruin, as I have before hinted, must have, at some
bygone period, belonged to the Jesuits; but so blown up
with sand was it when Dugald took possession that the
work of restoration to something like its pristine form had
been a task of no little difficulty. The building stood on
a slight eminence, and at one side grew a huge ombu-tree.
It was under this that the only inhabitable room lay.
This room had two windows, one on each side, facing each
other, one looking east, the other west. Neither glass nor
frames were in these windows, and probably had not
existed even in the Jesuits' time. The room was cooler
without any such civilized arrangements.</p>
<p>It was a lonesome, eerie place at the very best, and that
weird looking ombu-tree, spreading its dark arms above the
grey old walls, did not detract from the air of gloom that
surrounded it. Sometimes Archie said laughingly that the
tree was like a funeral pall. Well, the half-caste Indians
of the <i>estancias</i> used to give this ruin a wide berth; they
had nasty stories to tell about it, stories that had been
handed down through generations. There were few indeed
of even the Gauchos who would have cared to remain here
after night-fall, much less sleep within its walls. But
when Dugald's big lamp stood lighted on the table, when
a fire of wood burned on the low hearth, and a plentiful
repast, with bowls of steaming fragrant <i>maté</i>, stood before
the young men, then the room looked far from uncomfortable.</p>
<p>There was at each side a hammock hung, which our two
hunters slept in on nights when they had remained too
long on the hill, or wanted to be early at the chase in the
morning.</p>
<p>'Whose turn is it to light the fire to-night?' said
Dugald, one winter evening, as the two jogged along
together on their mules towards the ruin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></p>
<p>'I think it is mine, cousin. Anyhow, if you feel lazy I'll
make it so.'</p>
<p>'No, I'm not lazy, but I want to take home a bird or
two to-morrow that auntie's very soul loveth, so if you go
on and get supper ready I shall go round the red dune
and try to find them.'</p>
<p>'You won't be long?'</p>
<p>'I sha'n't be over an hour.'</p>
<p>Archie rode on, humming a tune to himself. Arrived
at the ruin, he cast the mule loose, knowing he would not
wander far away, and would find juicy nourishment among
the more tender of the cacti sprouts.</p>
<p>Having lit a roaring fire, and seen it burn up, Archie
spread asunder some of the ashes, and placed thereon a
huge pie-dish&mdash;not an empty one&mdash;to warm. Meanwhile
he hung a kettle of water on the hook above the fire, and,
taking up a book, sat down by the window to read by the
light of the setting sun until the water should boil.</p>
<p>A whole half-hour passed away. The kettle had rattled
its lid, and Archie had hooked it up a few links, so that the
water should not be wasted. It was very still and quiet
up here to-night, and very lonesome too. The sun had just
gone down, and all the western sky was aglow with clouds,
whose ever-changing beauty it was a pleasure to watch.
Archie was beginning to wish that Dugald would come,
when he was startled at hearing a strange and piercing cry
far down below him in the cactus jungle. It was a cry
that made his flesh quiver and his very spine feel cold. It
came from no human lips, and yet it was not even the
scream of a terror-struck mule. Next minute the mystery
was unravelled, and Dugald's favourite mule came galloping
towards the ruin, pursued by an enormous tiger, as the
jaguar is called here.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></div>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></div>
<p>Just as he had reached the ruin the awful beast had made
his spring. His talons drew blood, but the next moment
he was rolling on the ground with one eye apparently
knocked out, and the foam around his fang-filled mouth
mixed with blood; and the mule was over the hills and
safe, while the jaguar was venting his fume and fury on
Archie's rugs, which, with his gun, he had left out there.</p>
<p>There is no occasion to deny that the young man was
almost petrified with fear, but this did not last long: he
must seek for safety somehow, somewhere. To leave the
ruin seems certain death, to remain is impossible. Look,
the tiger even already has scented him; he utters another
fearful yell, and makes direct for the window. The tree!
the tree! Something seems to utter those words in his
ear as he springs from the open window. The jaguar has
entered the room as Archie, with a strength he never knew
he possessed, catches a lower limb and hoists himself up
into the tree. He hears yell after yell; now first in the
ruin, next at the tree foot, and then in the tree itself.
Archie creeps higher and higher up, till the branches can
no longer bear him, and after him creeps death in the
most awful form imaginable. Already the brute is so close
that he sees his glaring eye and hears his awful scenting
and snuffling. Archie is fascinated by that tiger's face so
near him&mdash;on the same limb of the tree, he himself far out
towards the point. This must be fascination. He feels
like one in a strange dream, for as the time goes by and
the tiger springs not, he takes to speculating almost calmly
on his fate, and wondering where the beast will seize him
first, and if it will be very painful; if he will hear his own
bones crash, and so faint and forget everything. What
fangs the tiger has! How broad the head, and terribly
fierce the grin! But how the blood trickles from the
wound in the skull! He can hear it pattering on the dead
leaves far beneath.</p>
<p>Why doesn't the tiger spring and have it over? Why
does&mdash;but look, look, the brute has let go the branch and
fallen down, down with a crash, and Archie hears the dull
thud of the body on the ground.</p>
<p>Dead&mdash;to all intents and purposes. The good mule's
hoof had cloven the skull.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>'Archie! Archie! where on earth are you? Oh,
Archie!'</p>
<p>It is Dugald's voice. The last words are almost a
shriek.</p>
<p>Then away goes fear from Archie's heart, and joy
unspeakable takes its place.</p>
<p>'Up here, Dugald,' he shouts, 'safe and sound.'</p>
<p>I leave the reader to guess whether Dugald was glad or
not to see his cousin drop intact from the ombu-tree, or
whether or not they enjoyed their pie and <i>maté</i> that
evening after this terrible adventure.</p>
<p>'I wonder,' said Archie, later on, and just as they were
preparing for hammock, 'I wonder, Dugald, if that tiger
has a wife. I hope she won't come prowling round after
her dead lord in the middle of the night.'</p>
<p>'Well, anyhow, Archie, we'll have our rifles ready, and
Dash will give us ample warning, you know. So good-night.'</p>
<p>'Good-night. Don't be astonished if you hear me
scream in my sleep. I feel sure I'll dream I'm up in that
dark ombu-tree, and perhaps in the clutches of that fearsome
tiger.'</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>About a month after the above related adventure the
young men had another at that very ruin, which, if not
quite so stirring, was at all events far more mysterious.</p>
<p>It happened soon after a wild storm, a kind of semi-pampero,
had swept over the glen with much thunder and
lightning and heavy rains. It had cleared the atmosphere,
however, which previously had been hazy and close. It
had cooled it as well, so that one afternoon, Dugald,
addressing Archie, said,</p>
<p>'What do you say to an early morning among the birds
to-morrow, cousin?'</p>
<p>'Oh, I'm ready, Dugald, if you are,' was the reply.</p>
<p>'Well, then, off you trot to the kitchen, and get food
ready, and I'll see to the shooting tackle and the mules.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>When Dugald ran over to say good-night to Moncrieff
and Aileen before they started, he met old Jenny in the
door.</p>
<p>'Dear laddie,' she said, when she heard he was bound
for the hills, 'I hope nae ill will come over ye; but I wot
I had an unco' ugly dream last night. Put your trust in
Providence, laddie. And ye winna forget to say your
prayers, will ye?'</p>
<p>'That we won't, mother. Ta, ta!'</p>
<p>Moncrieff saw Dugald to his own gate. With them
went Wolf, the largest bloodhound-mastiff.</p>
<p>'Dreams,' said Moncrieff, 'may be neither here nor
there; but you'll be none the worse for taking Wolf.'</p>
<p>'Thank you,' said Dugald; 'he shall come, and
welcome.'</p>
<p>The sun had quite set before they reached the ruin, but
there was a beautiful after-glow in the west&mdash;a golden
haze beneath, with a kind of crimson blush over it higher
up. When they were on a level with the ruin, the two
windows of which, as already stated, were opposite to each
other, Archie said, musingly,</p>
<p>'Look, Dugald, what a strange and beautiful light is
streaming through the windows!'</p>
<p>'Yes,' replied Dugald, 'but there is something solemn,
even ghostly, about it. Don't you think so?'</p>
<p>'True; there always is something ghostly about an
empty ruin, I think. Are you superstitious?'</p>
<p>'No; but&mdash;see. What was that? Why, there is some
one there! Look to your rifle, Archie. It was an Indian,
I am certain.'</p>
<p>What had they seen? Why, only the head and shoulders
of a passing figure in the orange light of the two windows.
It had appeared but one moment&mdash;next it was gone.
Rifles in left hand, revolvers in right, they cautiously
approached the ruin and entered. Never a soul was here.
They went out again, and looked around; they even
searched the ombu-tree, but all in vain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span></p>
<p>'Our eyes must have deceived us,' said Dugald.</p>
<p>'I think,' said Archie, 'I have a theory that might
explain the mystery.'</p>
<p>'What is it, then?'</p>
<p>'Well, that was no living figure we saw.'</p>
<p>'What! You don't mean to say, Archie, it was a
ghost?'</p>
<p>'No, but a branch of that ghostly ombu-tree moved by
a passing wind between us and the light.'</p>
<p>As he spoke they rounded the farthest off gable of the
ruin, and there both stopped as suddenly as if shot. Close
beside the wall, with some rude digging tools lying near,
was a newly-opened grave!</p>
<p>'This is indeed strange,' said Dugald, remembering old
Jenny's warning and dream; 'I cannot make it out.'</p>
<p>'Nor can I. However, we must make the best of it.'</p>
<p>By the time supper was finished they had almost forgotten
all about it. Only before lying down that night&mdash;</p>
<p>'I say, Archie,' said Dugald, 'why didn't we think of
it?'</p>
<p>'Think of what?'</p>
<p>'Why, of putting Wolf the mastiff on the track. If
there have been Indians here he would have found them out.'</p>
<p>'It will not be too late to-morrow, perhaps.'</p>
<p>Dugald lay awake till it must have been long past
midnight. He tried to sleep, but failed, though he could
tell from his regular breathing that nothing was disturbing
Archie's repose. It was a beautiful night outside, and the
light from a full moon streamed in at one window and fell
on the form of good Wolf, who was curled up on the floor;
the other window was shaded by the branches of the
ombu-tree. No matter how calm it might be in the
valley below, away up here there was always a light breeze
blowing, and to-night the whispering in the tree at times
resembled the sound of human voices. So thought Dugald.
Several times he started and listened, and once he felt
almost sure he heard footsteps as of people moving outside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
Then again all sounds&mdash;if sounds there had been&mdash;ceased,
and nothing was audible save the sighing wind in the
ombu-tree. Oh, that strange waving ombu-tree! He
wondered if it really had some dark secret to whisper to
him, and had chosen this silent hour of night to reveal it.</p>
<p>Hark, that was a sound this time! The mournful but
piercing cry of a night-bird. 'Chee-hee-ee! chee-hee-ee!'
It was repeated farther up the hill. But could the dog be
deceived? Scarcely; and growling low as if in anger,
Wolf had arisen and stood pointing towards the ombu-shaded
window.</p>
<p>With one accord both Dugald and Archie, seizing their
revolvers and jumping from their hammocks, ran out just
in time to see a tall figure cross a patch of moonlit sward
and disappear in the cactus jungle.</p>
<p>Both fired in the direction, but of course aimlessly, and
it was with the greatest difficulty they succeeded in keeping
the great dog from following into the bush.</p>
<p>They were disturbed no more that night; and daylight
quite banished their fears, though it could not dispel the
mystery of the newly-dug grave.</p>
<p>Indeed, they could even afford to joke a little over the
matter now.</p>
<p>'There is something in it, depend upon that,' said
Dugald, as the two stood together looking into the hole.</p>
<p>'There doesn't seem to be,' said Archie, quizzingly.</p>
<p>'And I mean to probe it to the bottom.'</p>
<p>'Suppose you commence now, Dugald. Believe me,
there is no time like the present. Here are the tools.
They look quite antediluvian. Do you think now that it
really was a flesh-and-blood Indian we saw here; or was
it the ghost of some murdered priest? And has he been
digging down here to excavate his own old bones, or have
a peep to see that they are safe?'</p>
<p>'Archie,' said Dugald, at last, as if he had not listened
to a word of his companion's previous remarks, 'Archie,
we won't go shooting to-day.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>'No?'</p>
<p>'No, we will go home instead, and bring Moncrieff and my
brothers here. I begin to think this is no grave after all.'</p>
<p>'Indeed, Dugald, and why?'</p>
<p>'Why, simply for this reason: Yambo has told me a
wonderful blood-curdling story of two hermit priests who
lived here, and who had found treasure among the hills,
and were eventually murdered and buried in this very ruin.
According to the tradition the slaughtering Indians were
themselves afterwards killed, and since then strange
appearances have taken place from time to time, and until
we made a shooting-box of the ruin no Gauchos could
be found bold enough to go inside it, nor would any
Indian come within half a mile of the place. That they
have got more courageous now we had ample evidence last
night.'</p>
<p>'And you think that&mdash;'</p>
<p>'I think that Indians are not far away, and that&mdash;but
come, let us saddle our mules and be off.'</p>
<p>It was high time, for at that very moment over a dozen
pairs of fierce eyes were watching them from the cactus
jungle. Spears were even poised ready for an attack, and
only perhaps the sight of that ferocious-looking dog
restrained them.</p>
<p>No one could come more speedily to a conclusion than
Moncrieff. He hardly waited to hear Dugald's story before
he had summoned Yambo, and bade him get ready with
five trusty Gauchos to accompany them to the hills.</p>
<p>'Guns, señor?'</p>
<p>'Ay, guns, Yambo, and the other dog. We may have
to draw a trigger or two. Sharp is the word, Yambo!'</p>
<p>In two hours more, and just as the winter's sun was at
its highest, we all reached the cactus near the old monastic
ruin. Here a spear flew close past Moncrieff's head. A
quick, fierce glance of anger shot from the eyes of this
buirdly Scot. He called a dog, and in a moment more
disappeared in the jungle. A minute after there was the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
sharp ring of a revolver, a shriek, a second shot, and all
was still. Presently Moncrieff rode back, looking grim,
but calm and self-possessed.</p>
<p>There was no one near the ruin when we advanced, but
the Indians had been here. The grave was a grave no
longer in shape, but a huge hole.</p>
<p>'Set to work, Yambo, with your men. They have saved
us trouble. Dugald and Archie and Donald, take three
men and the dogs and scour the bush round here. Then
place sentinels about, and post yourselves on top of the
red dune.'</p>
<p>Yambo and his men set to work in earnest, and laboured
untiringly for hours and hours, but without finding anything.
A halt was called at last for rest and refreshment;
then the work was commenced with greater heart than
ever.</p>
<p>I had ridden away to the red dune to carry food to my
brothers and the dogs and the sentinels.</p>
<p>The day was beginning already to draw to a close.
The sky all above was blue and clear, but along the
horizon lay a bank of grey rolling clouds, that soon would
be changed to crimson and gold by the rays of the setting
sun. Hawks were poised high in the air, and flocks of
kites were slowly winging their way to the eastward.</p>
<p>From our position on the summit of the red dune we
had a most extended view on all sides. We could even see
the tall waving poplars of our own <i>estancias</i>, and away
westward a vast rolling prairie of pampa land, bounded by
the distant <i>sierras</i>. My eyes were directed to one level
and snow-white patch in the plain, which might have been
about three square miles in extent, when suddenly out
from behind some dunes that lay beyond rode a party of
horsemen. We could tell at a glance they were Indians,
and that they were coming as fast as fleet horses could
carry them, straight for the hill on which we stood. There
was not a moment to lose, so, leaping to the back of my
mule, I hurried away to warn our party.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>A RIDE FOR LIFE.</h3>
</div>

<p>'Moncrieff!' I cried, as soon as I got within hail,
'the Indians will be on us in less than half an
hour!'</p>
<p>'Then, boy,' replied Moncrieff, 'call in your brothers and
the men; they cannot hold the dune. We must fight
them here, if it be fighting they mean. Hurry back, I
have something to show you.'</p>
<p>We had all returned in less than ten minutes. Greatly
to our astonishment, we found no one in the pit now, but
we heard voices beneath, and I hurried in and down.</p>
<p>They had found a cave; whether natural or not we
could not at present say. At one side lay a heap of
mouldering bones, in the opposite corner a huge wooden
chest. Moncrieff had improvised a torch, and surely
Aladdin in his cave could not have been more astonished
at what he saw than we were now! The smoky light fell
on the golden gleam of nuggets! Yes, there they were, of
all shapes and sizes. Moncrieff plunged his hand to the
bottom of the box and stirred them up as he might have
done roots or beans.</p>
<p>This, then, was the secret the ruin had held so long&mdash;the
mystery of the giant ombu-tree.</p>
<p>That the Indians in some way or other had got scent of
this treasure was evident, and as these wandering savages
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
care little if anything for gold on their own account, it was
equally evident that some white man&mdash;himself not caring
to take the lead or even appear&mdash;was hounding them on
to find it, with the promise doubtless of a handsome
reward.</p>
<p>Not a moment was there to be lost now. The treasure
must be removed. An attempt was first made to lift the
chest bodily. This was found to be impossible owing to
the decayed condition of the wood. The grain-sacks,
therefore, which formed a portion of the Gaucho's mule-trappings,
were requisitioned, and in a very short time
every gold nugget was carried out and placed in safety in
a corner of our principal room in the hunting-box.</p>
<p>The beasts were placed for safety in another room of the
ruin, a trench being dug before the door, which could be
commanded from one of our windows.</p>
<p>'How many horsemen did you count?' said Moncrieff
to me.</p>
<p>'As near as I could judge,' I replied, 'there must be
fifty.'</p>
<p>'Yes, there may be a swarm more. One of you boys
must ride to-night to the <i>estancia</i> and get assistance.
Who volunteers?'</p>
<p>'I do,' said Dugald at once.</p>
<p>'Then it will be well to start without delay before we
are surrounded. See, it is already dusk, and we may
expect our Indian friends at any moment. Mount, lad, and
Heaven preserve you!'</p>
<p>Dugald hardly waited to say another word. He saw to
the revolvers in his saddle-bows, slung his rifle over his
shoulder, sprang to the saddle, and had disappeared like a
flash.</p>
<p>And now we had but to wait the turn of events&mdash;turn
how they might.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Dugald told us afterwards that during that memorable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
ride to the <i>estancia</i> he felt as if the beast beneath him
was a winged horse instead of his own old-fashioned and
affectionate mule. Perhaps it was fear that lent him such
speed, and possibly it was fear transmitted even from his
rider. Times without number since we had come out to
our new home in the Silver West my brother had shown
what sort of stuff he was made of, but a ride like this is
trying to a heart like oak or nerves like steel, and a young
man must be destitute of soul itself not to feel fear on
such an occasion. Besides, the very fact of flying from
unseen foes adds to the terror.</p>
<p>Down through the cactus jungle he went, galloping in
and out and out and in, himself hardly knowing the road,
trusting everything to the sagacity of the wondrous mule.
Oftentimes when returning from a day on the hills, tired
and weary, he had thought the way through this strange
green bushland interminably long; but now, fleetly though
he was speeding on, he thought it would never, never end,
that he would never, never come out into the open
braeland, and see, miles away beneath him, the twinkling
lights of the <i>estancia</i>. Many an anxious glance, too, did
he cast around him or into the gloomiest shades of the
jungle, more than once imagining he saw dusky figures
therein with long spears ready to launch at him.</p>
<p>He is out at last, however; but the path is now loose
and rough and stony. After riding for some hundred
yards he has to cut across at right angles to the jungle he
has left. To his horror, a dozen armed Indians at that
very moment leave the cactus, and with levelled spears
and wild shouts dash onward to intercept him. This is
indeed a ride for life, for to his immediate left is a precipice
full twenty feet in height. He must gain the end of this
before he can put even a yard of actual distance betwixt
himself and the savages who are thirsting for his life.
More than once he has half made up his mind to dare the
leap, but the venture is far too great.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer sweep the Indians. Dugald is close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
at the turning-point now, but he sees the foremost savage
getting the deadly lasso ready. He must shoot, though he
has to slacken speed slightly to take better aim.</p>
<p>He fires. Down roll horse and man, and Dugald is
saved.</p>
<p>They have heard that rifle-shot far away on the <i>estancia</i>.
Quick eyes are turned towards the braelands, and, dusk
though it is, they notice that something more than usual is
up. Five minutes afterwards half a dozen armed horsemen
thunder out to meet Dugald. They hear his story, and all
return to alarm the colony and put the whole place in a
state of defence. Then under the guidance of Dugald they
turn back once more&mdash;a party of twenty strong now&mdash;towards
the hills, just as the moon, which is almost full, is
rising and shining through between the solemn steeple-like
poplars.</p>
<p>To avoid the jungle, and a probable ambuscade, they
have to make a long <i>détour</i>, but they reach the ruin at last,
to find all safe and sound. The Indians know that for a
time their game is played, and they have lost; and they
disappeared as quickly and mysteriously as they came
leaving not a trace behind.</p>
<p>The gold is now loaded on the backs of the mules, and
the journey home commenced.</p>
<p>As they ride down through the giant cacti two huge
vultures rise with flapping wings and heavy bodies at no
great distance. It was into that very thicket that
Moncrieff rode this morning. It was there he fired his
revolver. The vultures had been disturbed at a feast&mdash;nothing
more.</p>
<p>Great was the rejoicing at the safe return of Moncrieff
and his party from the hills. Our poor aunt had been
troubled, indeed, but Aileen was frantic, and threw herself
into her husband's arms when she saw him in quite a
passion of hysterical joy.</p>
<p>Now although there was but little if any danger of an
attack to-night on the <i>estancias</i>, no one thought of retiring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
to bed. There was much to be done by way of preparation,
for we were determined not to lose a horse, nor even a
sheep, if we could help it. So we arranged a code of
signals by means of rifle-shots, and spent the whole of the
hours that intervened betwixt the time of our return and
sunrise in riding round the farms and visiting even distant
<i>puestos</i>.</p>
<p>My brothers and I and Moncrieff lay down when day
broke to snatch a few hours of much-needed rest.</p>
<p>It was well on in the forenoon when I went over to
Moncrieff's mansion. I had already been told that
strangers had arrived from distant <i>estancias</i> bringing evil
tidings. The poor men whom I found in the drawing-room
with Moncrieff had indeed brought dreadful news.
They had escaped from their burned <i>estancias</i> after seeing
their people massacred by savages before their eyes. They
had seen others on the road who had suffered even worse,
and did not know what to do or where to fly. Many
had been hunted into the bush and killed there. Forts
had been attacked further south, and even the soldiers of
the republic in some instances had been defeated and
scattered over the country.</p>
<p>The year, indeed, was one that will be long remembered
by the citizens of the Argentine Republic. Happily
things have now changed for the better, and the Indians
have been driven back south of the Rio Negro, which
will for ever form a boundary which they must not cross
on pain of death.</p>
<p>More fugitives dropped in that day, and all had pitiful,
heartrending stories to tell.</p>
<p>Moncrieff made every one welcome, and so did we all,
trying our very best to soothe the grief and anguish they
felt for those dear ones they would never see more on
earth.</p>
<p>And now hardly a day passed that did not bring news
of some kind of the doings of the Indians. Success had
rendered them bold, while it appeared to have cowed for a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
time the Government of this noble republic, or, at all
events, had confused and paralyzed all its action. Forts
were overcome almost without resistance. Indeed, some
of them were destitute of the means of resisting, the men
having no proper supply of ammunition. <i>Estancia</i> after
<i>estancia</i> on the frontier had been raided and burned, with
the usual shocking barbarities that make one shudder even
to think of.</p>
<p>It was but little likely that our small but wealthy
colony would escape, for the fact that we were now possessed
of the long-buried treasure&mdash;many thousands of
pounds in value&mdash;must have spread like wild-fire.</p>
<p>One morning Moncrieff and I started early, and rode to
a distant <i>estancia</i>, which we were told had been attacked
and utterly destroyed, not a creature being left alive about
the place with the exception of the cattle and horses,
which the Indians had captured. We had known this
family. They had often attended Moncrieff's happy little
evening parties, and the children had played in our garden
and rowed with us in the gondola.</p>
<p>Heaven forbid I should attempt to draw a graphic
picture of all we saw! Let it be sufficient to say that the
rumours which had reached us were all too true, and that
Moncrieff and I saw sights which will haunt us both
until our dying day.</p>
<p>The silence all round the <i>estancia</i> when we rode up was
eloquent, terribly eloquent. The buildings were blackened
ruins, and it was painful to notice the half-scorched trailing
flowers, many still in bloom, clinging around the
wrecked and charred verandah. But everywhere about,
in the out-buildings, on the lawn, in the garden itself, were
the remains of the poor creatures who had suffered.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Moncrieff spoke but little all the way back. While
standing near the verandah I had seen him move his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
hand to his eyes and impatiently brush away a tear, but
after that his face became firm and set, and for many a
day after this I never saw him smile.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>At this period of our strange family story I lay down
my pen and lean wearily back in my chair. It is not
that I am tired of writing. Oh, no! Evening after evening
for many and many a long week I have repaired up
here to my turret chamber&mdash;my beautiful study in our
Castle of Coila&mdash;and with my faithful hound by my feet
I have bent over my sheets and transcribed as faithfully
as I could events as I remember them. But it is the very
multiplicity of these events as I near the end of my story
that causes me to pause and think.</p>
<p>Ah! here comes aunt, gliding into my room, pausing for
a moment, curtain in hand, half apologetically, as she did
on that evening described in our first chapter.</p>
<p>'No, auntie, you do not disturb me. Far from it. I
was longing for your company.'</p>
<p>She is by my side now, and looking down at my manuscript.</p>
<p>'Yes,' she says many times&mdash;nodding assent to every
sentence, and ever turning back the pages for reference&mdash;'yes,
and now you come near the last events of
this story of the M'Crimmans of Coila. Come out to
the castle roof, and breathe the evening air, and I will
talk.'</p>
<p>We sit there nearly an hour. Aunt's memory is better
even than mine, and I listen to her without ever once
opening my lips. Then I lead her back to the tower, and
point smilingly to the harp.</p>
<p>She has gone at last, and I resume my story.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>We, Moncrieff and I, saw no signs of Indians during our
long ride that day. We had gone on this journey with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
our lives in our hands. The very daringness and dash of
it was probably our salvation. The enemy were
about&mdash;they might be here, there, anywhere. Every
bush might conceal a foe, but they certainly made no
appearance.</p>
<p>All was the same apparently about our <i>estancias</i>; <i>but</i> I
wondered a little that my brothers had not come out
to meet me as usual, and that faithful, though plain-faced
Yambo looked at me strangely, and I thought
pityingly, as he took my mule to lead away to the
compound.</p>
<p>I went straight away through our gardens, and entered
the drawing-room by the verandah window.</p>
<p>I paused a moment, holding the casement in my hand.
Coming straight out of the glare of the evening sunset,
the room appeared somewhat dark, but I noticed Dugald
sitting at the table with his face bent down over his hand,
and Donald lying on the couch.</p>
<p>'Dugald!'</p>
<p>He started up and ran towards me, seizing and wringing
my hand.</p>
<p>'Oh, Murdoch,' he cried, 'our poor father!'</p>
<p>'You have had a letter&mdash;he is ill?'</p>
<p>'He is ill.'</p>
<p>'Dugald,' I cried, 'tell me all! Dugald&mdash;is&mdash;father&mdash;dead?'</p>
<p>No reply.</p>
<p>I staggered towards the table, and dropped limp and
stricken and helpless into a chair.</p>
<p>I think I must have been ill for many, many days after
this sad news. I have little recollection of the events of
the next week&mdash;I was engrossed, engulfed in the one great
sorrow. The unexpected death of so well-beloved a father
in the meridian of life was a terrible blow to us all, but
more so to me, with all I had on my mind.</p>
<p>'And so, and so,' I thought, as I began to recover, 'there
is an end to my bright dreams of future happiness&mdash;<i>the</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
dream of all my dreams, to have father out here among us
in our new home in the Silver West, and all the dark
portions of the past forgotten. Heaven give me strength
to bear it!'</p>
<p>I had spoken the last words aloud, for a voice at my
elbow said&mdash;</p>
<p>'Amen! Poor boy! Amen!'</p>
<p>I turned, and&mdash;<i>there stood Townley</i>.</p>
<p>'You wonder to see me here,' he said, as he took
my hand. 'Nay, but nobody should ever wonder at
anything I do. I am erratic. I did not come over before,
because I did not wish to influence your mind. You have
been ill, but&mdash;I'm glad to see you weeping.'</p>
<p>I did really sob and cry then as if my very heart would
burst and break.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>I was well enough in a day or two to hear the rest of
the news. Townley, who was very wise, had hesitated to
tell me everything at once.</p>
<p>But if anything could be called joyful news now surely
this was&mdash;mother and Flora were at Villa Mercedes, and
would be here in a day or two. Townley had come on
before, even at considerable personal risk, to break the
news to us, and prepare us all. Mother and sister were
waiting an escort, not got up specially for them certainly,
but that would see to their safety. It consisted
of a large party of officers and men who were passing
on to the frontiers to repel, or try to repel, the Indian invasion.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>We all went to meet mother and sister at the far-off
cross roads. There was quite a large and very well-armed
party of us, and we encamped for three days near an
<i>estancia</i> to await their coming.</p>
<p>It was on the morning of the fourth day that one of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span>
Gauchos reported an immense cloud of dust far away
eastwards on the Mendoza road.</p>
<p>'They might be Indians,' he added.</p>
<p>'Perhaps,' said Moncrieff, 'but we will risk it.'</p>
<p>So camp was struck and off we rode, my brothers and I
forming the vanguard, Moncrieff and Archie bringing up
the rear. How my heart beat with emotion when the first
horsemen of the advancing party became visible through
the cloud of dust, and I saw they were soldiers!</p>
<p>On we rode now at the gallop.</p>
<p>Yes, mother was there, and sister, and they were well.
Our meeting may be better imagined than described.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Both mother and Flora were established at the <i>estancia</i>,
and so days and weeks flew by, and I was pleased to see
them smile, though mother looked sad, so sad, yet so
beautiful, just as she had ever looked to me.</p>
<p>Dugald was the first to recover anything approaching
to a chastened happiness. He had his darling sister
with him. He was never tired taking her out and
showing her all the outs-and-ins and workings of our new
home.</p>
<p>It appeared to give him the chiefest delight, however, to
see her in the gondola.</p>
<p>I remember him saying one evening:</p>
<p>'Dear Flora! What a time it seems to look back since
we parted in old Edina. But through all these long years
I have worked for you and thought about you, and strange,
I have always pictured you just as you are now, sitting
under the gondola awnings, looking piquant and pretty,
and on just such a lovely evening as this. But I didn't
think you would be so big, Flora.'</p>
<p>'Dear stupid Dugald!' replied Flora, blushing slightly
because Archie's eyes were bent on her in admiration,
respectful but unconcealable. 'Did you think I would
always remain a child?'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>'You'll always be a child to me, Flo,' said Dugald.</p>
<p>But where had the Indians gone?</p>
<p>Had our bold troops beaten them back? or was the
cloud still floating over the <i>estancia</i>, and floating only to
burst?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>THE ATTACK ON THE ESTANCIA.</h3>
</div>

<p>Shortly after we had all settled down at the <i>estancia</i>,
and things began to resume their wonted appearance,
albeit we lived in a state of constant preparation to repel
attack, an interview took place one day in Moncrieff's
drawing-room, at which, though I was not present, I now
know all that happened.</p>
<p>To one remark of Townley's my mother replied as
follows:</p>
<p>'No, Mr. Townley, I think with you. I feel even more
firmly, I believe, than you do on the subject, for you speak
with, pardon me, some little doubt or hesitancy. Our boy's
conscience must not be tampered with, not for all the
estates in the world. Much though I love Coila, from
which villainy may have banished us, let it remain for
ever in the possession of the M'Rae sooner than even hint
to Murdoch that an oath, however imposed, is not binding.'</p>
<p>'Yes,' said Townley, 'you are right, Mrs. M'Crimman;
but the present possessor of Coila, the younger Le Roi, or
M'Rae, as he was called before his father's death, has what
he is pleased to call broader views on the subject than we
have.'</p>
<p>'Mr. Townley, the M'Rae is welcome to retain his broad
views, and we will stick to the simple faith of our forefathers.
The M'Rae is of French education.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>'Yes, and at our meeting, though he behaved like a
perfect gentleman&mdash;indeed, he is a gentleman&mdash;'</p>
<p>'True, in spite of the feud I cannot forget that the
M'Raes are distant relatives of the M'Crimmans. He
must, therefore, be a gentleman.'</p>
<p>'"My dear sir," he said to me, "I cannot conceive of such
folly"&mdash;superstitious folly, he called it&mdash;"as that which
your young friend Murdoch M'Crimman is guilty of. Let
him come to me and say boldly that the ring found in the
box and in the vault was on the finger of Duncan&mdash;villain
he is, at all events&mdash;on the night he threatened to
shoot him, and I will give up all claim to the estates of
Coila; but till he does so, or until you bring me other
proof, I must be excused for remaining where I am."'</p>
<p>'Then let him,' said my mother quietly.</p>
<p>'Nay, but,' said Townley, 'I do not <i>mean</i> to let him.
It has become the one dream of my existence to see justice
and right done to my dear old pupil Murdoch, and I think
I begin to see land.'</p>
<p>'Yes?'</p>
<p>'I believe I do. I waited and watched untiringly.
Good Gilmore, who still lives in Coila, watched for me
too. I knew one thing was certain&mdash;namely, that the
ex-poacher Duncan M'Rae would turn up again at the
castle. He did. He went to beg money from the M'Rae.
The M'Rae is a man of the world; he saw that this visit
of Duncan's was but the beginning of a never-ending
persecution. He refused Duncan's request point-blank.
Then the man changed flank and breathed dark threatenings.
The M'Rae, he hinted, had better not make him
(Duncan) his enemy. He (M'Rae) was obliged to him for
the house and position he occupied, but the same hand that
<i>did</i> could <i>undo</i>. At this juncture the M'Rae had simply
rung the bell, and the ex-poacher had to retire foiled, but
threatening still. It was on that same day I confronted
him and told him all I knew. Then I showed him the
spurious ring, which, as I placed it on my finger, even he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
could not tell from the original. Even this did not overawe
him, but when I ventured a guess that this very ring
had belonged to a dead man, and pretended I knew more
than I did, he turned pale. He was silent for a time&mdash;thinking,
I suppose. Then he put a question which
staggered me with its very coolness, and, clergyman though
I am, I felt inclined at that moment to throttle the man
where he stood. Would we pay him handsomely for
turning king's evidence on himself and confessing the
whole was a conspiracy, and would we save him from the
legal penalty of the confessed crime?</p>
<p>'I assure you, Mrs. M'Crimman, that till then I had
leaned towards the belief that, scoundrel though this
Duncan be, some little spark of humanity remained in his
nature, and that he might be inclined to do justice for
justice's sake. I dare say he read my answer in my eyes,
and he judged too that for the time being I was powerless
to act. Could he have killed me then, I know he would
have done so. Once more he was silent for a time. He
did not dare to repeat his first question, but he put another,
"Have you any charge to make against me about <i>anything</i>?"
He placed a terribly-meaning emphasis on that word
"anything." I looked at him. I was wondering whether he
really had had anything to do with the death of old
Mawsie, and if the ring of which I had the facsimile on my
finger had in reality belonged to a murdered man. Seeing
me hesitate, he played a bold card; it was, I suppose,
suggested to him by the appearance at that moment of
the village policeman walking calmly past the window of
the little inn where we sat. He knocked, and beckoned
to him, while I sat wondering and thinking that verily the
man before me was cleverer by far than I. On the entrance
of the policeman&mdash;"This gentleman, policeman," he said,
quietly and slowly, "makes or insinuates charges against
me in private which now in your presence I dare him to
repeat." Then turning to me&mdash;"The ball is with you," he
said. And what could I reply? Nothing. I do believe
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
that at that very moment even the worthy village policeman
noticed and pitied my position, for he turned to
Duncan, and, nodding, made this remark in Gaelic: "I
know Mr. Townley as a gentleman, and I know you, Duncan
M'Rae, to be something very different. If Mr. Townley
makes no charge against you it is no doubt because he is
not prepared with proofs. But, Duncan, boy, if you like
to remain in the glen for a few days, I'm not sure there
isn't a charge or two I could rub up against you myself."</p>
<p>'I left the room with the policeman. Now I knew
that, although foiled, Duncan did not consider himself
beaten. I had him watched therefore, and followed by a
detective. I wanted to find out his next move. It was
precisely what I thought it would be. He had heard of
our poor chief M'Crimman's death, remember. Well, a
day or two after our conversation in the little inn at Coila,
Duncan presented himself at the M'Rae's advocate's office
and so pleaded his case&mdash;so begged and partially hinted at
disclosures and confessions&mdash;that this solicitor, not
possessed of the extraordinary pride and independence
of the M'Rae&mdash;'</p>
<p>'A pride and independence, Mr. Townley,' said my aunt,
'which the M'Raes take from their relatedness to our
family.'</p>
<p>'That is true,' said my mother.</p>
<p>'Well, I was going to say,' continued Townley, 'that
Duncan so far overcame the advocate that this gentleman
thought it would be for his client's interest to accede in
part to his demands, or rather to one of them&mdash;viz., to pay
him a sum of money to leave the country for ever. But
this money was not to be paid until he had taken his
passage and was about to sail for some&mdash;any&mdash;country, not
nearer than the United States of America, Mr. Moir's&mdash;the
advocate's&mdash;clerk was to see him on board ship, and
see him sail.'</p>
<p>'And did he sail?' said my aunt, as Townley paused and
looked at her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>'Yes, in a passenger ship, for Buenos Ayres.'</p>
<p>'I see it all now,' said my aunt. 'He thinks that no
charge can be made against him there for conspiracy or
crime committed at home.'</p>
<p>'Yes, and he thinks still further: he thinks that he will
be more successful with dear Murdoch than he was with
either the M'Rae or myself.'</p>
<p>There was a few minutes' pause, my aunt being the
first to break the silence.</p>
<p>'What a depth of well-schemed villainy!' was the remark
she made.</p>
<p>Moncrieff had listened to all the conversation without
once putting in a word. Now all he said was&mdash;</p>
<p>'Dinna forget, Miss M'Crimman, the words o' the
immortal Bobbie Burns:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>"The best laid schemes o' mice and men</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>To the fear and fever consequent upon the depredations
committed by the Indians there succeeded a calmness and
lull which the canny Moncrieff thought almost unnatural,
considering all that had gone before. He took pains to
find out whether, as had been currently reported, our
Argentine troops had been victorious all along the frontier
line. He found that the report, like many others, had
been grossly exaggerated. If a foe retires, a foe is beaten
by the army which <i>sees</i> that foe retire. This seems too
often to be the logic of the war-path. In the present
instance, however, the Indians belonged to races that lived
a nomad life. They were constantly advancing and
retreating. When they chose to advance in this particular
year there was not a sufficient number of cavalry to oppose
them, nor were the soldiers well mounted. The savages
knew precisely on what part of the stage to enter, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
they did not think it incumbent on them to previously
warn our Argentine troops. Indeed, they, like sensible
savages, rather avoided a conflict than courted one. It
was not conflict but cattle they were after principally;
then if at any time strategy directed retreat, why, they
simply turned their horses' heads to the desert, the pampas,
or mountain wilds, and the troops for a time had seen the
last of them.</p>
<p>I think Moncrieff would have made a capital general,
for fancied security never sent him to sleep. What had
happened once might happen again, he thought, and his
<i>estancias</i> were big prizes for Indians to try for, especially
as there was plenty to gain by success, and little to lose
by defeat.</p>
<p>I have said that our Coila Villa was some distance
from the fortified Moncrieff houses. It was now connected
with the general rampart and ditches. It was part and
parcel of the whole system of fortification; so my brothers
and I might rest assured it would be defended, if ever
there was any occasion.</p>
<p>'It seems hard,' said Townley to Moncrieff one day,
'that you should be put to so much trouble and expense.
Why does not the Government protect its settlers?'</p>
<p>'The Government will in course of time,' replied
Moncrieff. 'At present, as we lie pretty low down in the
western map, we are looked upon as rich pioneers, and
left to protect ourselves.'</p>
<p>They were riding then round the <i>estancias</i>, visiting
outlying <i>puestos</i>.</p>
<p>'You have your rockets and red-lights for night signals,
and your flags for day use?' Moncrieff was saying to each
<i>puestero</i> or shepherd.</p>
<p>'We have,' was the invariable reply.</p>
<p>'Well, if the Indians are sighted, signal at once, pointing
the fan in their direction, then proceed to drive the flocks
towards the <i>estancias</i>. There,' continued Moncrieff, 'there
is plenty of corraling room, and we can concentrate a fire
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
that will, I believe, effectually hold back these raiding
thieves.'</p>
<p>One day there came a report that a fort had been
carried by a cloud of Indians.</p>
<p>This was in the forenoon. Towards evening some
Gauchos came in from a distant <i>estancia</i>. They brought
the old ugly story of conflagration and murder, to which
Moncrieff and his Welsh partner had long since become
used.</p>
<p>But now the cloud was about to burst over our <i>estancia</i>.
We all ate our meals together at the present awful crisis,
just, I think, to be company to each other, and to talk and
keep up each other's heart.</p>
<p>But to-day Moncrieff had ordered an early dinner, and
this was ominous. Hardly any one spoke much during
the meal. A heaviness was on every heart, and if any one
of us made an effort to smile and look cheerful, others
saw that this was only assumed, and scarcely responded.</p>
<p>Perhaps old Jenny spoke more than all of us put
together. And her remarks at times made us laugh,
gloomy though the situation was.</p>
<p>'They reeving Philistines are coming again, are they?
Well, laddie, if the worst should happen I'll just treat
them to a drap parridge.'</p>
<p>'What, mither?'</p>
<p>'A drap parridge, laddie. It was boiled maize I poured
ower the shoulders o' them in the caravan. But oatmeal
is better, weel scalded. Na, na, naething beats a drap
parridge. Bombazo,' she said presently,'you've been unco
quiet and douce for days back, I hope you'll no show the
white feather this time and bury yoursel' in the moold like
a rabbit.'</p>
<p>Poor Bombazo winced, and really, judging from his
appearance, he had been ill at ease for weeks back. There
was no singing now, and the guitar lay unheeded in its case.</p>
<p>'Do not fear for me, lady. I am burning already to see
the foe.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>'Weel, Bombazo man, ye dinna look vera warlike.
You're unco white about the gills already, but wae worth
the rigging o' you if ye dinna fecht. My arm is strong to
wield the auld ginghamrella yet.'</p>
<p>'Hush, mither, hush!' said Moncrieff.</p>
<p>Immediately after dinner Moncrieff beckoned to
Townley, and the two left the room and the house
together.</p>
<p>'You think the Indians will come to-night?' said
Townley, after a time.</p>
<p>'I know they will, and in force too.'</p>
<p>'Well, I feel like an idler. You, General Moncrieff,
have not appointed me any station.'</p>
<p>Moncrieff smiled.</p>
<p>'I am now going to do so,' he said, 'and it is probably
the most important position and trust on the <i>estancia</i>.'</p>
<p>They walked up as far as the great canal while they
conversed.</p>
<p>Arrived there, Moncrieff pointed to what looked like a
bundle of brushwood.</p>
<p>'You see those branches?'</p>
<p>'Yes.'</p>
<p>'And you see that wooden lock or huge doorway?'</p>
<p>'I do.'</p>
<p>'Well, my friend, the brushwood conceals a sentry-box.
It overlooks the whole <i>estancia</i>. It conceals something
else, a small barrel of gunpowder, which you are to hang
to the hook yonder on the wooden lock, and explode the
moment you have the signal.'</p>
<p>'And the signal will be?'</p>
<p>'A huge rocket sent up from either my <i>estancia</i> house
or Coila Villa. There may be several, but you must act
when you see the first. There is fuse enough to the bomb
to give you time to escape, and the bomb is big enough to
burst the lock and flood the whole ditch system in and
around the <i>estancia</i>. You are to run as soon as you fire.
Further on you will find another brushwood place of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
concealment. Hide there. Heaven forbid I should
endanger a hair of your head! Now you know your
station!'</p>
<p>'I do,' said Townley, 'and thankful I am to think I can
be of service in this great emergency.'</p>
<p>Before dark all the most valuable portion of our stock
was safely corraled, and silence, broken only by the
occasional lowing of the cattle or the usual night sounds
of farm life, reigned around and over the <i>estancia</i>.</p>
<p>Later on Townley stole quietly out, and betook himself
to his station.</p>
<p>Still later on Yambo rode in and right up to the
verandah of our chief sitting-room. The horse he bestrode
was drenched in sweat. He had seen Indians in force;
they were even now advancing. He had ridden for his
life.</p>
<p>The order 'Every man to his quarters!' was now given.</p>
<p>The night which was to be so terrible and so memorable
in the annals of Moncrieff's <i>estancia</i> had begun. It was
very still, and at present very dark. But by and by the
moon would rise.</p>
<p>'A rocket, sir!' we heard Archie shout from his post
as sentinel; 'a rocket from the south-western <i>puesto</i>.'</p>
<p>We waited, listening, starting almost at every sound.
At length in the distance we could plainly hear the sound
of horses' hoofs on the road, and before many minutes
the first <i>puestero</i> rode to the gate and was admitted. The
men from the other <i>puestos</i> were not far behind; and, all
being safe inside, the gates were fastened and fortified by
triple bars of wood.</p>
<p>All along the ditches, and out for many yards, was
spread such a thorny spikework of pointed wood as to
defy the approach of the cleverest Indian for hours at
least.</p>
<p>While we waited I found time to run round to the
drawing-room. There was no sign of fear on any face there,
with the exception perhaps of that of poor Irish Aileen.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
And I could well believe her when she told me it was
not for herself she cared, but for her 'winsome man.'</p>
<p>I was talking to them as cheerfully as I could, when I
heard the sound of a rifle, and, waving them good-bye, I
rushed off to my station.</p>
<p>Slowly the moon rose, and before many minutes the
whole <i>estancia</i> was flooded with its light. And how
we thanked Heaven for that light only those who have
been situated as we were now can fully understand.</p>
<p>Up it sailed between the dark whispering poplars. Never
had these trees seemed to me more stately, more noble.
Towering up into the starry sky, they seemed like sentinels
set to guard and defend us, while their taper fingers,
piercing heavenwards, carried our thoughts to One who
never deserts those who call on Him in faith in their hour
of need.</p>
<p>The moon rose higher and higher, and its light&mdash;for it
was a full moon&mdash;got still more silvery as it mounted
towards its zenith. But as yet there was no sign that a
foe as remorseless and implacable as the tiger of the jungle
was abroad on the plains.</p>
<p>A huge fire had been erected behind the mansion, and
about ten o'clock the female servants came round our lines
with food, and huge bowls of steaming <i>maté</i>.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after we were at our quarters again.</p>
<p>I was stationed near our own villa. Leaning over a
parapet, I could not help, as I gazed around me, being
struck with the exceeding beauty of the night. Not far
off the lake shone in the moon's rays like a silver mirror,
but over the distant hills and among the trees and hedges
was spread a thin blue gauzy mist that toned and softened
the whole landscape.</p>
<p>As I gazed, and was falling into a reverie, a puff of white
smoke and a flash not fifty yards away, and the ping of a
bullet close to my ear, warned me that the attack had
commenced.</p>
<p>There had been no living thing visible just before then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
but the field on one side of our villa was now one moving
mass of armed Indians, rushing on towards the ditch and
breastwork.</p>
<p>At the same moment all along our lines ran the rattle of
rifle-firing. That savage crowd, kept at bay by the spikework,
made a target for our men that could hardly be
missed. The war-cry, which they had expected to change
in less than a minute to the savage shout of victory, was
mingled now with groans and yells of anger and pain.</p>
<p>But this, after all, was not the main attack. From a
red signal-light far along the lines I soon discovered that
Moncrieff was concentrating his strength there, and I
hastened in that direction with five of my best men. The
Indians were under the charge of a <i>cacique</i> on horseback,
whose shrill voice sounded high over the din of battle and
shrieks of the wounded. He literally hurled his men like
seas against the gates and ramparts here.</p>
<p>But all in vain. Our fellows stood; and the <i>cacique</i> at
length withdrew his men, firing a volley or two as they
disappeared behind the hedges.</p>
<p>There was comparative silence for a space now. It was
soon broken, however, by the thunder of Indian cavalry.
The savages were going to change their tactics.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>THE LAST ASSAULT.</h3>
</div>

<p>Never before, perhaps, in all the annals of Indian
warfare had a more determined attack been made
upon a settler's <i>estancia</i>. The <i>cacique</i> or <i>caciques</i> who
led the enemy seemed determined to purchase victory at
any cost or hazard. Nor did the principal <i>cacique</i>
hesitate to expose himself to danger. During the whole
of the first onset he moved about on horseback close in
the rear of his men, and appeared to bear a charmed
life. The bullets must have been whizzing past him as
thick as flies. Moncrieff himself tried more than once to
bring him down, but all in vain.</p>
<p>During the final assault he was equally conspicuous;
he was here, there, and everywhere, and his voice and
appearance, even for a moment, among them never failed
to cause his men to redouble their efforts.</p>
<p>It was not, however, until far on into the night that this
last and awful charge was made.</p>
<p>The savage foe advanced with a wild shout all along
the line of rampart that connected the Moncrieff main
<i>estancia</i> with our villa. This was really our weakest part.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<div class='figcenter'>

</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></div>
<p>The assault was made on horseback. We heard them
coming thundering on some time before we saw them
and could fire. They seemed mad, furious; their tall
feather-bedecked spears were waved high in air; they sat
like huge baboons on their high saddles, and their very
horses had been imbued with the recklessness of their
riders, and came on bounding and flying over our frail
field of spikes. It was to be all spear work till they
came to close quarters; then they would use their deadly
knives.</p>
<p>Hardly had the first sound of the horses' hoofs reached
our ears ere one, two, three rockets left Coila Villa; and
scarcely had they exploded in the air and cast their
golden showers of sparks abroad, before the roar of an
explosion was heard high up on the braeland that shook
the houses to their very foundations&mdash;and then&mdash;there is
the awful rush of foaming, seething water.</p>
<p>Nothing could withstand that unexpected flood; men
and horses were floated and washed away, struggling and
helpless, before it.</p>
<p>Just at the time when the last assault was nearly at its
grim close I felt my arm pulled, and looking quickly
round found Yambo at my side. He still clutched me
by the arm, but he was waving his blood-stained sword in
the direction of Moncrieff's house, and I could see by the
motions of his mouth and face he wished me to come with
him.</p>
<p>Something had occurred, something dreadful surely,
and despite the excitement of battle a momentary cold
wave of fear seemed to rush over my frame.</p>
<p>Sandie Donaldson was near me. This bold big fellow
had been everywhere conspicuous to-night for his bravery.
He had fought all through with extraordinary intrepidity.</p>
<p>Wherever I had glanced that night I had seen Sandie,
the moon shining down on the white shirt and trousers he
wore, and which made him altogether so conspicuous a
figure, as he took aim with rifle or revolver, or dashed
into a crowd of spear-armed Indians, his claymore hardly
visible, so swiftly was it moved to and fro. I grasped his
shoulder, pointed in the direction indicated by Yambo,
and on we flew.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>As soon as we had rounded the wing of an outbuilding
and reached Moncrieff's terraced lawn, the din of the fight
we had just left became more indistinct, but we now heard
sounds that, while they thrilled us with terror and anger,
made us rush on across the grass with the speed of the
panther.</p>
<p>They were the voices of shrieking women, the crashing
of glass and furniture, and the savage and exultant yell of
the Indians.</p>
<p>Looking back now to this episode of the night, I can
hardly realize that so many terrible events could have
occurred in so brief a time, for, from the moment we
charged up across the lawn not six minutes could have
elapsed ere all was over. It is like a dream, but a dream
every turn of which has been burned into my memory, to
remain while life shall last. Yonder is a tall <i>cacique</i>
hurrying out into the bright moonlight from under the
verandah. He bears in his arms the inanimate form of my
dear sister Flora. Is it really <i>I</i> myself who rush up to
meet him? Have <i>I</i> fired that shot that causes the savage
to reel and fall? Is it I who lift poor Flora and lay her in
the shade of a mimosa-tree? It must be I, yet every action
seems governed by instinct; I am for the time being a
strange psychological study. It is as if my soul had left
the body, but still commanded it, standing aside, ruling
every motion, directing every blow from first to last, and
being implicitly obeyed by the other <i>ego</i>, the <i>ego</i>-incorporate.
There is a crowd, nay, a cloud even it seems, around me;
but see, I have cut my way through them at last: they
have fallen before me, fallen at my side&mdash;fallen or fled. I
step over bodies, I enter the room, I stumble over other
bodies. Now a light is struck and a lamp is lit, and
standing beside the table, calm, but very pale, I see my
aunt dimly through the smoke. My mother is near her&mdash;my
own brave mother. Both have revolvers in their hands;
and I know now why bodies are stretched on the floor.
One glance shows me Aileen, lying like a dead thing in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
chair, and beside her, smoothing her brow, chafing her
hands, Moncrieff's marvellous mother.</p>
<p>But in this life the humorous is ever mixed up with the
tragic or sad, for lo! as I hurry away to join the fight that
is still going on near the verandah I almost stumble across
something else. Not a body this time&mdash;not quite&mdash;only
Bombazo's ankles sticking out from under the sofa. I
could swear to those striped silk socks anywhere, and the
boots are the boots of Bombazo. I administer a kick to
those shins, and they speedily disappear. I am out on the
moonlit lawn now, and what do I see? First, good brave
Yambo, down on one knee, being borne backwards, fierce
hands at his throat, a short knife at his chest. The
would-be assassin falls; Yambo rises intact, and together
we rush on further down to where, on a terrace, Donaldson
has just been overpowered. But see, a new combatant has
come upon the scene; several revolver shots are fired in
quick succession. A tall dark figure in semi-clerical garb
is cutting right and left with a good broadsword. And
now&mdash;why, now it is all over, and Townley stands beside
us panting.</p>
<p>Well might he pant&mdash;he had done brave work. But he
had come all too late to save Sandie. He lies there quietly
enough on the grass. His shirt is stained with blood, and
it is his own blood this time.</p>
<p>Townley bends over and quietly feels his arm. No pulse
there. Then he breathes a half audible prayer and
reverently closes the eyes.</p>
<p>I am hurrying back now to the room with Flora.</p>
<p>'All is safe, mother, now. Flora is safe. See, she is
smiling: she knows us all. Oh, Heaven be praised, she is
safe!'</p>
<p>We leave Townley there, and hurry back to the
ramparts.</p>
<p>The stillness alone would have told us that the fight was
finished and the victory won.</p>
<p>A few minutes after this, standing high up on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
rampart there, Moncrieff is mustering his people. One
name after another is called. Alas! there are many who
do not answer, many who will never answer more, for our
victory has been dearly bought.</p>
<p>Four of our Scottish settlers were found dead in the
trench; over a dozen Gauchos had been killed. Moncrieff
and his partner were both wounded, though neither
severely. Archie and Dugald were also badly cut, and
answered but faintly and feebly to the roll-call. Sandie we
know is dead, and Bombazo is&mdash;under the sofa. So I
thought; but listen.</p>
<p>'Captain Rodrigo de Bombazo!'</p>
<p>'Here, general, here,' says a bold voice close behind me,
and Bombazo himself presses further to the front.</p>
<p>I can hardly believe my eyes and ears. Could those
have been Bombazo's boots? Had I really kicked the
shins of Bombazo? Surely the events of the night had
turned my brain. Bombazo's boots indeed! Bombazo
skulk and hide beneath a sofa! Impossible. Look at him
now. His hair is dishevelled; there is blood on his brow.
He is dressed only in shirt and trousers, and these are
marked with blood; so is his right arm, which is bared
over the elbow, and the sword he carries in his hand.
Bold Bombazo! How I have wronged him! But the
silk striped socks? No; I cannot get over that.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Barely a month before the events just narrated took
place at the <i>estancias</i> of Moncrieff there landed from a
sailing ship at the port of Buenos Ayres a man whose age
might have been represented by any number of years
'twixt thirty and forty. There were grey hairs on his
temples, but these count for nothing in a man whose life
has been a struggle with Fortune and Fate. The
individual in question, whom his shipmates called Dalston,
was tall and tough and wiry. He had shown what he was
and what he could do in less than a week from the time of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
his joining. At first he had been a passenger, and had
lived away aft somewhere, no one could tell exactly where,
for he did not dine in the saloon with the other passengers,
and he looked above messing with the stewards. As the
mate and he were much together it was supposed that
Dalston made use of the first officer's cabin. The ship
had encountered dirty weather from the very outset; head
winds and choppy seas all the way down Channel, so that
she was still 'kicking about off the coast'&mdash;this is how the
seamen phrased it&mdash;when she ought to have been crossing
the Bay or stretching away out into the broad Atlantic.
She fared worse by far when she reached the Bay, having
met with a gale of wind that blew most of her cloth to
ribbons, carried away her bowsprit, and made hurdles of
her bulwarks both forward and amidships. Worse than all,
two men were blown from aloft while trying to reef a sail
during a squall of more than hurricane violence. I say
blown from aloft, and I say so advisedly, for the squall
came on after they had gone up, a squall that even the men
on deck could not stand against, a squall that levelled the
very waves, and made the sea away to leeward&mdash;no one
could see to windward&mdash;look like boiling milk.</p>
<p>The storm began to go down immediately after the
squall, and next day the weather was fine enough to make
sail, and mend sail. But the ship was short-handed, for
the skipper had made no provision against loss by accident.
He was glad then when the mate informed him that the
'gentleman' Dalston was as good as any two men on
board.</p>
<p>'Send him to me,' said the skipper.</p>
<p>'Good morning. Ahem, I hear, sir, you would be
willing to assist in the working of the ship. May I ask on
what terms?'</p>
<p>'Certainly,' said Dalston. 'I'm going out to the
Argentine, to buy a bit of land; well, naturally, money is
some object to me. You see?'</p>
<p>'I understand.'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>'Well, my terms are the return of my passage money
and civility.'</p>
<p>'Agreed; but why do you mention civility?'</p>
<p>'Because I've heard you using rather rough language to
your men. Now, if you forgot yourself so far as to call me
a bad name I'd&mdash;&mdash;'</p>
<p>He paused, and there was a look in his eyes the captain
hardly relished.</p>
<p>'Well! What would you do?'</p>
<p>'Why, I'd&mdash;retire to my cabin.'</p>
<p>'All right then, I think we understand each other.'</p>
<p>So Dalston was installed, and now dined forward. He
became a favourite with his messmates. No one could tell
a more thrilling and adventuresome yarn than Dalston,
no one could sing a better song than himself or join more
heartily in the chorus when another sang, and no one
could work more cheerily on deck, or fly more quickly
to tack a sheet.</p>
<p>Smyth had been the big man in the forecastle before
Dalston's day. But Smyth was eclipsed now, and I dare say
did not like his rival. One day, near the quarter-deck,
Smyth called Dalston an ugly name. Dalston's answer
was a blow which sent the fellow reeling to leeward, where
he lay stunned.</p>
<p>'Have you killed him, Dalston?' said the captain.</p>
<p>'Not quite, sir; but I could have.'</p>
<p>'Well, Dalston, you are working for two men now; don't
let us lose another hand, else you'll have to work for
three.'</p>
<p>Dalston laughed.</p>
<p>Smyth gathered himself up and slunk away, but his look
was one Dalston would have cause to remember.</p>
<p>This good ship&mdash;Sevenoaks she was called, after the
captain's wife's birthplace&mdash;had a long and a rough passage
all along. The owners were Dutchmen, so it did not
matter a very great deal. There was plenty of time, and the
ship was worked on the cheap. Perhaps the wonder is she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
kept afloat at all, for at one period of the voyage she leaked
so badly that the crew had to pump three hours out of
every watch. Then she crossed a bank on the South
American coast, and the men said she had sucked in a bit
of seaweed, for she did not leak much after this.</p>
<p>The longest voyage has an end, however, and when the
Sevenoaks arrived at Buenos Ayres, Dalston bade his
messmates adieu, had his passage money duly returned,
and went on shore, happy because he had many more
golden sovereigns to rattle than he had expected.</p>
<p>Dalston went to a good hotel, found out all about the
trains, and next day set out, in company with a waiter
who had volunteered to be his escort, to purchase a proper
outfit&mdash;only light clothes, a rifle, a good revolver, and a
knife or two to wear in his belt, for he was going west to
a rough country.</p>
<p>In the evening, after the waiter and he had dined well at
another hotel:</p>
<p>'You go home now,' said Dalston; 'I'm going round to
have a look at the town,'</p>
<p>'Take care of yourself,' the waiter said.</p>
<p>'No fear of me,' was the laughing reply.</p>
<p>But that very night he was borne back to his inn, cut,
bruised, and faint.</p>
<p>And robbed of all his gold.</p>
<p>'Who has done this?' said the waiter, aghast at his
friend's appearance.</p>
<p>'Smyth!' That was all the reply.</p>
<p>Dalston lay for weeks between life and death. Then he
came round almost at once, and soon started away on his
journey. The waiter&mdash;good-natured fellow&mdash;had lent him
money to carry him to Mendoza.</p>
<p>But Dalston's adventures were not over yet.</p>
<p>He arrived at Villa Mercedes well and hopeful, and was
lucky enough to secure a passage in the diligence about to
start under mounted escort to Mendoza. After a jolting
ride of days, the like of which he had never been used to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
in the old country, the ancient-looking coach had completed
three-quarters of the journey, and the rest of the road
being considered safe the escort was allowed to go on its
way to the frontier.</p>
<p>They had not departed two hours, however, before the
travellers were attacked, the driver speared, and the horses
captured. The only passenger who made the slightest
resistance was Dalston. He was speedily overpowered,
and would have been killed on the spot had not the
<i>cacique</i> of the party whom Dalston had wounded interfered
and spared his life.</p>
<p>Spared his life! But for what? He did not know.
Some of the passengers were permitted to go free, the rest
were killed. He alone was mounted on horseback, his
legs tied with thongs and his horse led by an Indian.</p>
<p>All that night and all next day his captors journeyed
on, taking, as far as Dalston could judge, a south-west
course. His sufferings were extreme. His legs were
swollen, cut, and bleeding; his naked shoulders&mdash;for they
had stripped him almost naked&mdash;burned and blistered
with the sun; and although his tongue was parched and
his head drooping wearily on his breast, no one offered him
a mouthful of water.</p>
<p>He begged them to kill him. Perhaps the <i>cacique</i>,
who was almost a white man, understood his meaning, for
he grinned in derision and pointed to his own bullet-wounded
arm. The <i>cacique</i> knew well there were
sufferings possible compared to which death itself would
be as pleasure.</p>
<p>When the Indians at last went into camp&mdash;which they
did but for a night&mdash;he was released, but guarded; a hunk
of raw guanaco meat was thrown to him, which he tried
to suck for the juices it contained.</p>
<p>Next day they went on and on again, over a wild pampa
land now, with here and there a bush or tussock of grass
or thistles, and here and there a giant ombu-tree. His
ankles were more painful than ever, his shoulders were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
raw, the horse he rode was often prodded with a spear, and
he too was wounded at the same time. Once or twice the
<i>cacique</i>, maddened by the pain of his wound, rushed at
Dalston with uplifted knife, and the wretched prisoner
begged that the blow might fall.</p>
<p>Towards evening they reached a kind of hill and forest
land, where the flowering cacti rose high above the tallest
spear. Then they came to a ruin. Indians here were in
full force, horses dashed to and fro, and it was evident
from the bustle and stir that they were on the war-path,
and soon either to attack or be attacked.</p>
<p>The prisoner was now roughly unhorsed and cruelly
lashed to a tree, and left unheeded by all. For a moment
or two he felt grateful for the shade, but his position after
a time became painful in the extreme. At night-fall all
the Indians left, and soon after the sufferings of the poor
wretch grew more dreadful than pen can describe. He
was being slowly eaten alive by myriads of insects that
crept and crawled or flew; horrid spiders with hairy legs
and of enormous size ran over his neck and naked chest,
loathsome centipedes wriggled over his shoulders and face
and bit him, and ants covered him black from head to feet.
Towards dusk a great jaguar went prowling past, looked
at him with green fierce eyes, snarled low, and went on.
Vultures alighted near him, but they too passed by; they
could wait. Then it was night, and many of the insect pests
grew luminous. They flitted and danced before his eyes
till tortured nature could bear no more, and insensibility
ended his sufferings for a time.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The Indians must have thought that, although their
attack on our <i>estancia</i> had failed, we were too weak or too
frightened to pursue them. They did not know Moncrieff.
Wounded though he was, he had issued forth from behind
the ramparts with thirty well-armed and splendidly-mounted
men. They followed the enemy up for seven long hours,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
and succeeded in teaching them such a lesson that they
have never been seen in that district since.</p>
<p>Towards noon we were riding homewards, tired and
weary enough now, when Donald suggested our visiting
the old Jesuit ruin, and so we turned our horses' heads in
that direction.</p>
<p>Donald had ridden on before, and as I drew near I
heard him cry, 'Oh, Moncrieff, come quickly! Here is
some poor fellow lashed to the ombu-tree!'</p>

</div>

<p>We cut the man's cords of thongs, we spread rugs on
the grass and laid him gently down, then bathed
his poor body with wine, and poured a little down his
throat.</p>
<p>In about half an hour the wretched being we had
thought dead slowly raised himself on his elbow and
gazed at <i>me</i> as well as his swollen eyes would permit him.
His lips moved as if to speak, but no intelligible sound
escaped them. The recollection dawned on my mind all
at once, and in that sadly-distorted face I discovered traces
of the man who had wrought us so much sorrow and evil.</p>
<p>I took his hand in mine.</p>
<p>'Am I right?' I said. 'Are you Duncan M'Rae?'</p>
<p>He nodded drowsily, closed his eyes again, and lay back.</p>
<p>We cut branches from the ombu-tree, tied them
together with the thongs that had bound the victim's
limbs, and so made a litter. On this we placed rugs and
laid the man; and between two mules he was borne by
the Gauchos slowly homewards to the <i>estancias</i>. Poor
wretch! he had expected to come here all but a conqueror,
and in a position to dictate his own terms&mdash;he arrived a
dying man.</p>
<p>Our <i>estancia</i> for many weeks was now turned almost
into a hospital, for even those Indians who had crept
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
wounded into the bush, preferring to die at the sides of
hedges to falling into our hands, we had brought in and
treated with kindness, and many recovered.</p>
<p>All the dead we could find we buried in the humble
little graveyard on the braeside. We buried them without
respect of nationality, only a few feet of clay separating
the white man's grave from that of his Indian foe.</p>
<p>'It matters little,' said Moncrieff. 'where one rests,</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>"For still and peaceful is the grave,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Where, life's vain tumults past,</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Receives us all at last."'</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Both Dugald and Archie made excellent patients, and
Flora and Aileen the best of nurses. But <i>the</i> nurse over
even these was old Jenny. She was hospital superintendent,
and saw to all the arrangements, even making
the poultices and spreading the salves and plasters with
her own hands.</p>
<p>'My mither's a ma<i>rr</i>vel at he<i>rr</i>bs!' said Moncrieff over
and over again, when he saw the old lady busy at work.</p>
<p>There was one patient, and only one, whom old Jenny
did not nurse. This was Duncan himself. For him
Townley did all his skill could suggest, and was seldom
two consecutive hours away from the room where he lay.</p>
<p>In spite of all this it was evident that the ex-poacher
was sinking fast.</p>
<p>Then came a day when Moncrieff, Archie, and myself
were called into the dying man's apartment, and heard
him make the fullest confession of all his villainy, and beg
for our forgiveness with the tears roiling down his wan,
worn face.</p>
<p>Yes, we forgave him willingly.</p>
<p>May Heaven forgive him too!</p>
<p>At the time of his confession he was strong enough to
read over and sign the document that Townley placed
before him. He told Townley too the addresses of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
men who had assisted him in the old vault at the ruined
kirk in Coila.</p>
<p>And Duncan had seemed brighter and calmer for
several days after this. But he told us he had no desire
to live now.</p>
<p>Then, one morning the change came, and so he sank
and died.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was several months before we could make up our
minds to leave 'Our Home in the Silver West.' Indeed,
there was considerable preparation to be made for the
long homeward voyage that was before us; besides,
Townley had no inclination to hurry matters now that he
felt sure of victory.</p>
<p>Victory was not even yet a certainty, however. The
estate of Coila was well worth fighting for. Was there
not the possibility, the bare possibility, that the solicitors
or advocates of Le Roi, or the M'Rae, who now held the
castle and glen, might find some fatal flaw in the evidence
which Townley had spent so much time and care in
working out and collecting?</p>
<p>It was not at all probable. In fact, despite the blood-feud,
that ancient family folly, I believed that M'Rae
would act the part of a gentleman.</p>
<p>'If,' said Townley to me one day, as we walked for
almost the last time in the beautiful gardens around
Moncrieff's mansion-house, 'we have anything to fear, I
believe it is from the legal advisers of the present
"occupier"'&mdash;Townley would not say 'owner'&mdash;'of the
estate. These men, you know, Murdoch, can hardly
expect to be <i>our</i> advocates. They are well aware that if
they lose hold of Coila now the title-deeds thereof will
never again rest in the fireproof safes of their offices.'</p>
<p>'I am afraid,' I said, 'you have but a poor opinion of
Edinburgh advocates.'</p>
<p>'Not so, Murdoch, not so. But,' he added, meaningly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
'I have lived longer in life than you, and I have but a
poor opinion of human nature.'</p>
<p>'I suppose,' I said, 'that the M'Rae will know nothing
of what is coming till our arrival on Scottish shores!'</p>
<p>'On the contrary,' answered Townley; 'although it
may really seem like playing into our opponent's hands, I
have written a friendly letter to the M'Rae, and have told
him to be prepared; that I have irrefragable evidence&mdash;mind,
I do not particularize&mdash;that you, Murdoch M'Crimman,
are the true and only proprietor of the estates of
Coila. I want him to see and feel that I am treating him
as the man of honour I believe him to be, and that the
only thing we really desire is justice to all concerned.'</p>
<p>I smiled, and could not help saying, 'Townley, my
best of friends, what an excellent advocate you would have
made!'</p>
<p>Townley smiled in turn.</p>
<p>'Say, rather,' he replied, 'what an excellent detective I
should have made! But, after all, Murdoch, it may turn
out that there is a spice of selfishness in all I am doing.'</p>
<p>'I do not believe a word of it, Townley.'</p>
<p>Townley only laughed, and looked mysterious.</p>
<p>'Hold on a little,' he said; 'don't be too quick to express
your judgment.'</p>
<p>'I will wait, then,' I answered; 'but really I cannot
altogether understand you.'</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Perhaps nothing shows true physical courage better than
the power to say 'Farewell' apparently unmoved. It is a
kind of courage, however, that is very rare indeed, and all
sorts of stratagems have been adopted to soften the grief
of parting. I am not sure that I myself was not guilty of
adopting one of these on the morning we left that pleasant
home by the lake.</p>
<p>'I'm not going to say "farewell" at all,' I insisted, as I
shook hands with Irish Aileen and poor old Jenny,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
Moncrieff's 'marvellous mither.' 'I'm coming out again
to see you all as soon as ever I can get settled. Do you
think I could leave this beautiful country entirely, without
spending at least a few more years in it? Not I! And
even if I do succeed in getting old Coila back once more&mdash;even
that, mind, is uncertain&mdash;I sha'n't quite give up Coila
New. So <i>au revoir</i>, Moncrieff; <i>au revoir</i>!'</p>
<p>Then, turning to Jenny, '<i>Au revoir</i>, Jenny,' I said.</p>
<p>'Guid-bye, laddie, and God be wi' ye. I canna speak
French. I've tried a word or twa mair than once, and
nearly knocked my jaws out o' the joint; so I'll just say
"Guid-bye." Lang, lang ere you can come back to Coila
New puir old Jenny's bones will be in the mools.'</p>
<p>I felt a big lump in my throat just then, and was
positively grateful when Bombazo strutted up dressed in
full uniform.</p>
<p>'<i>A dios</i>', he said; 'my friend, <i>a dios</i>. And now you
have but to say the word, and if you have the least fear of
being molested by Indians, my trusty sword is at your
service, and I will gladly escort you as far as Villa
Mercedes.'</p>
<p>It is needless to say that I declined this truly heroic
offer.</p>
<p>Our party&mdash;the departing one&mdash;consisted of mother,
aunt, Townley, Archie, and myself. My sister and my
brothers came many miles on the road with us; then we
bade them good-bye, and I felt glad when that was
over.</p>
<p>But Moncrieff's convoy was a truly Scottish one. He
and his good men never thought of turning back till they
had seen us safely on board the train, and rapidly being
whirled away southwards.</p>
<p>As long as I could see this honest settler he was waving
his broad bonnet in the air, and&mdash;I felt sure of this&mdash;commending
us all to a kind Providence.</p>
<p>The vessel in which we took passage was a steamer
that bore us straight to the Clyde. Our voyage was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
splendid one; in fact, I believe we were all just a little
sorry when it was finished.</p>
<p>Landing there in the Broomielaw on a cold forenoon in
early spring would have possessed but little of interest for
any of us&mdash;so full were our minds with the meeting that
was before us, the meeting of M'Crimman and M'Rae&mdash;only
we received a welcome that, being all so unexpected,
caused tears of joy to spring to my eyes. For hardly was
the gangway thrust on board from the quay ere more than
twenty sturdy Highlanders, who somehow had got possession
of it, came rushing and shouting on board. I knew every
face at once, though some were changed&mdash;with illness,
years, or sorrow.</p>
<p>Perhaps few such scenes had ever before been witnessed
on the Broomielaw, for those men were arrayed in the full
Scottish costume and wore the M'Crimman tartan, and their
shouts of joy might have been heard a good half-mile off,
despite the noises of the great city.</p>
<p>How they had heard of our coming it never occurred to
me to inquire. Suffice it to say that here they were, and
I leave the reader to guess the kind of welcome they gave
us.</p>
<p>No, nothing would satisfy them short of escorting us to
our hotel.</p>
<p>Our carriages, therefore, to please these kindly souls
from Coila, were obliged to proceed but slowly, for five
pipers marched in front, playing the bold old air of 'The
March of the Cameron Men,' while the rest, with drawn
claymores, brought up the rear.</p>
<p>On the very next day Townley, Archie, and I received a
message from M'Rae himself, announcing that he would
gladly meet us at the Royal Hotel in Edinburgh. We
were to bring no advocate with us, the letter advised; if
any dispute arose, then, and not till then, would be the
time to call in the aid of the law.</p>
<p>I confess that I entered M'Rae's room with a beating
heart. How would he receive us?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>We found him quietly smoking a cigar and gazing out
of the window.</p>
<p>But he turned with a kindly smile towards us as soon
as we entered, and the next minute we were all seated round
the table, and business&mdash;<i>the</i> business&mdash;was entered into.</p>
<p>M'Rae listened without a word. He never even
moved a muscle while Townley told all his long story, or
rather read it from paper after paper, which he took from
his bag. The last of these papers was Duncan's own
confession, with Archie's signature and mine as witnesses
alongside Moncrieff's.</p>
<p>He opened his lips at last.</p>
<p>'This is your signature, and you duly attest all this?'</p>
<p>He put the question first to Archie and then to me.</p>
<p>Receiving a reply in the affirmative, it was but natural
that I should look for some show of emotion in M'Rae's
face. I looked in vain. I have never seen more consummate
coolness before nor since. Indeed, it was a
coolness that alarmed me.</p>
<p>And when he rose from the table after a few minutes
of apparently engrossing thought, and walked directly
towards a casket that stood on the writing-table, I
thought that after all our cause was lost.</p>
<p>In that casket, I felt sure, lay some strange document
that should utterly undo all Townley's work of years.</p>
<p>M'Rae is now at the table. He opens the casket, and
for a moment looks critically at its contents.</p>
<p>I can hear my heart beating. I'm sure I look pale
with anxiety.</p>
<p>Now M'Rae puts his hand inside and quietly takes
out&mdash;a fresh cigar.</p>
<p>Then, humming a tune the while, he brings the casket
towards Townley, and bids him help himself.</p>
<p>Townley does as he is told, but at the same time bursts
into a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>'Mr. M'Rae,' he says, 'you are the coolest man that ever
I met. I do believe that if you were taken out to be shot&mdash;'
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>'Stay,' said M'Rae, 'I <i>was</i> once. I was tried for a
traitor&mdash;tried for a crime in France called "Treason," that
I was as guiltless of as an unborn babe&mdash;and condemned.'</p>
<p>'And what did you do?'</p>
<p>'Some one on the ground handed me a cigar, and&mdash;I
lit it.</p>
<p>'Nay, my dear friends, I have lost my case here.
Indeed, I never, it would seem, had one.</p>
<p>'M'Crimman,' he continued, shaking me by the hand,
'Coila is yours.'</p>
<p>'Strathtoul,' I answered, 'is our blood feud at an
end?'</p>
<p>'It is,' was the answer; and once again hand met
hand across the table.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Need I tell of the home-coming of the M'Crimmans of
Coila? Of the clansmen who met us in the glen and
marched along with us? Of the cheering strains of music
that re-echoed from every rock? Of the flags that
fluttered over and around our Castle Coila? Of the
bonfires that blazed that night on every hill, and cast
their lurid light across the darkling lake? Or of the
tears my mother shed when, looking round the tartan
drawing-room, the cosiest in all the castle, she thought of
father, dead and gone? No, for some things are better
left to the reader's imagination.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>I throw down my pen with a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>I think I have finished my story; my noble deerhound
thinks so too. He gets slowly up from the hearthrug,
conies towards me, and places his honest head on my
arm, but his eyes are fixed on mine.</p>
<p>It is not patting that he wants, nor petting either.</p>
<p>'Come out now, master,' he seems to say, speaking
with soft brown eyes and wagging tail; 'come out,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
master; mount your fleetest horse, and let us have a
glorious gallop across the hills. See how the sun shines
and glitters on grass, on leaves and lake! While you
have been writing there day after day, I, your faithful
dog, have been languishing. Come, master, come!'</p>
<p>And we go together.</p>
<p>When I return, refreshed, and run up stairs to the
room in the tower, I find dear auntie there. She has
been reading my manuscript.</p>
<p>'There is,' she says, 'only one addition to make.'</p>
<p>'Name it, auntie,' I say; 'it is not yet too late.'</p>
<p>But she hesitates.</p>
<p>'It is almost a secret,' she says at last, bending down
and smoothing the deerhound.</p>
<p>'A secret, auntie? Ha, ha!' I laugh. 'I have it,
auntie! I have it!'</p>
<p>And I kiss her there and then.</p>
<p>'It is Townley's secret and yours. He has proposed,
and you are to&mdash;'</p>
<p>But auntie has run out of the room.</p>
<p>And now, come to think of it, there is something to
add to all this.</p>
<p>Can you guess <i>my</i> secret, reader mine?</p>
<p>Irene, my darling Irene and I, Murdoch M'Crimman,
are also to be&mdash;</p>
<p>But, there, you have guessed my secret, as I guessed
auntie's.</p>
<p>And just let me ask this: Could any better plan
have been devised of burying the hatchet betwixt two
rival Highland clans, and putting an end for ever to a
blood feud?</p>
